"Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call presenting the resultsof Hannover Re for the first nine months of this year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As usual, I'll start with an overviewbefore our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the financials in more detail",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And then, Iwill comment on the outlook for this year and for 2022",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" For the Q&A, as always, I'madditionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"In the first nine months of this year, Hannover Re has again proved its resilience in achallenging market environment in life and health reinsurance",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The results continued to beimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And in P&C reinsurance, we had to deal with theelevated large losses from natural catastrophes, most prominently the European floodsand Hurricane Ida in the third quarter",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"The fact that we still achieved a double-digit return on equity, year-to-date highlights thestrong underlying profitability of the group and our successful volatility management",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Additionally, the group net income of EUR856 million is in line with our full year targetrange of EUR1",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
15 billion to EUR1,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"25 billion, and hence, we have kept our profit guidanceunchanged",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Gross premium increased by 14,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
4% adjusted for currency effects,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" This is mainly driven byour P&C business group, where we recorded continued strong top line growth on theback of improving market conditions and increased demand from our clients, althoughgrowth in life and health reinsurance was also ahead of our expectations",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"In P&C reinsurance, the large loss impact of more than EUR1 billion was clearly above ourbudget for the first nine months",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Adjusted for this quarterly budget overrun, the technicalprofitability was, however, in line with our expectations",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Furthermore, this is supported by our unchanged net estimate of COVID-19 relatedlosses, which has now been stable since the end of 2020 at EUR950 million",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Asmentioned, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a significant impact in life andhealth reinsurance",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Within our portfolio, the main markets affected by COVID-relatedexcess mortality of the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
", but also South Africa, where Hannover Re has a very strongmarket position",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"All-in-all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR404 million and most notablythe third quarter losses of around EUR140 million, came ahead of our initial expectation",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 mortality portfolio led to apositive one-off effect of EUR129 million,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Additionally, we recorded a positive effect ofEUR99 million from reserve releases in the longevity in Q3, partly mitigating the COVID-19impact",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
At 2,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"9%, the return on investment is significantly ahead of our expectations, mainly drivenby favorable ordinary income",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Our capitalization according to Solvency II continued to beexcellent confirmed by our strong solvency ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter,well above our 200% threshold",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" The main reason for the decrease in the third quarter isthe increase in required capital due to the attractive business growth, including the growthwe expect to see in 2022",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" This leads to an increase in SCR, whereas the positive impacton own funds is less immediate due to our conservative assumptions for new business",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Furthermore, large losses in P&C and COVID losses in life and health, had a negativeimpact on the solvency ratio year-to-date",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
The operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2021 reached a record high of EUR4,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"2billion, mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results onthe investment side",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from therestructuring within our U,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 mortality portfolio of EUR640 million,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Overall, the positive cash flow fueled the strong growth in assets under ownmanagement to an all-time high of about EUR55 billion",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" This growth was additionallysupported by ForEx effects and the issuance of EUR750 million in hybrid capital, alreadyknown in March",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" This bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our totalhybrid capital to EUR3 billion",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Despite this issuance, we still have material flexibility inregard to our total hybrid capacity",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" On the right-hand side, you can see that our strongprofitability is the main reason for the increase in shareholders' equity",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And additionally,the change in OCI was slightly positive, because negative valuation effect were offset bypositive currency translation",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Thank you, Jean-Jacques and good morning, everyone",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 I would dive straight into thereporting for our business groups and start with P&C,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 We now look back at all importantrenewal dates in 2021,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 And you can see gross and net premium in P&C reinsurance grewby a remarkable 18% adjusted for currency effect,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"The growth is highly diversified with particularly strong momentum in North America, inGermany, and in Southeast Asia",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" On top of this, we successfully expanded our structuredreinsurance book, and we also were able to increase the volume of our facultativereinsurance book",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As in previous years, we would expect the growth in gross premium toslow down somewhat; however, the net premium growth should remain more stable",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"As you all know, the impact from large losses was significant in the third quarter of 2021",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"For Hannover Re, this resulted in net large losses of EUR1",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"07 billion for the first ninemonths, clearly above our budget of EUR849 million for the first nine months",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" The net lossestimate for COVID-19 related losses, however, remained unchanged at EUR950 million",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"All together, the combined ratio of 97",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"9% for the first nine months is very solid, in light ofthe observed loss activity and the underlying figures are in line with our targets",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Net investment income in P&C increased based on strong ordinary income, higherrealized gains, and lower impairments",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Other income and expenses include negativecurrency effects of EUR105 million,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" In the previous year, we had almost the same amountas a positive contribution, and I alluded to that already in the second quarter, that it ismainly an accounting mismatch as we have a similar movement in our equity",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" All together,the EBIT increased strongly to EUR161 million, thanks to the improved investment resultsand the favorable underwriting result, which had been heavily impacted by COVID lossesin the previous year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Finally, the tax ratio is at normal level",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the next slide, as mentioned, total net large losses accounted for EUR1",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"07 billion,that's EUR221 million above budget",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 This means that we have already almost reached thelevel of EUR1,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
1 billion budgeted for the full year after the first nine months,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Of course, theyear-to-date budget overall is absorbed in the Q3 result, and hence the EUR251 millionbudgeted for Q3 -- for Q4, are still available",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the next slide, looking at our large losses, the two largest events were unsurprisinglythe European floods with a net loss of EUR214 million and Hurricane Ida with EUR306million net for our account",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" On top of this, we have seen further increases in the lossestimates for storm Volker and the Texas freeze on the NatCat side",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" However, man-madelosses also increased by slightly more than EUR100 million in Q3, almost entirely due tothe riots in South Africa, which are included in the property losses with an amount ofEUR94 million",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Altogether, the impact from both NatCat and man-made losses wassignificant in Q3, pushing the actual loss experience above the budget for the first ninemonths",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"The next slide, as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reportingline",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The picture I'd say very much reflects the large loss situation,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" I've just explained,combined ratios for EMEA, affected by the European floods and by the riots in SouthAfrica, while the Americas include significant losses from Hurricane Ida and the Texasfreeze",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
The worldwide markets show a rather mixed picture,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Facultative and agricultural businessare mainly impacted by large losses in the technical profitability and credit and surety, aswell as in aviation and marine, is really excellent driven by favorable underlying lossdevelopment and positive reserve runoff",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Let's move on to life and health, then on the next slide",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The pleasing business growth isreflected in both the premium and in value of new business,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And really, I'd say, comesfrom all our four important categories",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Growth is actually quite diversified by region aswell,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the technical result was still affected by losses inconnection with COVID-19",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Around 85% of the losses stemmed from two markets, EUR197million from the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 and EUR149 million from South Africa,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" The losses in South Africa wereparticularly significant in the third quarter, whereas the losses from the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 were lowerthan in previous quarters,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the positive side, we recorded a positive effect of EUR99 million from reservereleases for our longevity portfolio",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" In part to really avoid misunderstandings, I think thisneeds some additional explanation",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" You might be wondering how we can have furtherreserve releases when we have locked in assumptions according to address foraccounting and usually, we do not even have to set up reserves for this kind of treaties",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"The reason is that we have so-called provisions for adverse developments and as Claudealready explained at our Investors Day, not long ago in recent months, we have receivedupdated mortality data from our clients, showing that the mortality within our enforceportfolio has been higher than expected",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Hence, we could release those provisions for adverse developments those had, becausemore people in our portfolio have actually died than initially assumed, not because weassume any different mortality trends for the future",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"In other words, the impact does not reflect any general change in assumptions for ourlongevity business, which would be uncertain, but only higher mortality in the enforcebook, which of course is completely certain",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Furthermore, it is also important to note that the updated mortality data is largely for preCOVID period and not affected by the pandemic",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Finally, as explained in our Q1 conference call, the restructuring of parts of the INGportfolio in U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 mortality led to a positive one-off effect affecting various lines items in theP&L,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" In total, the positive impact was EUR129 million",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The ordinary investment income wasin line with expectations,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The fair value of financial instruments decreased materially,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Thenegative impact was driven by the valuation of derivative embedded in a life reinsurancecontract in the UK,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And additionally, the previous year had benefited from positivevaluation gains from an equity participation",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution fromour Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which is recognized according to thedeposit accounting method",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Currency effect here in line and has had a rather minorimpact,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Altogether, the EBIT of EUR220 million is satisfactory, reflecting theaforementioned positive and negative extraordinary effects",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the next slide, as usual, a quick look at the non-IFRS metric for business growth in lifeand health, the value of new business according to Solvency II",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" In Q3, we again tookadvantage of the attractive opportunities for financial solutions in the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
", but also inChina and we further expanded our longevity book in the UK",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The total value of newbusiness for the first nine months supports our full year minimum target of EUR250million,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Furthermore, the pipeline currently looks very promising, and I would say we arewell on track in terms of new business production",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the next slide, the development of our investments",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 I think it's fair to say that thedevelopment in the first quarter and in the first nine months of the year was verysatisfactory,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The ordinary investment income is particularly strong,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The main drivers for thisdevelopment are the excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Then theoverall asset growth fueled by our very positive cash flow as well as the impact fromincreased actual inflation numbers and the associated positive impact on the amortizationof our inflation linked bond,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Realized gains have also increased compared to last year and are mainly the result ofroutine portfolio management as well as some strategic -- let's say, as we mentioned thesale of listed equities in the first quarter, which have contributed EUR50 million to therealized gains",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous year,where we had recorded some impairments in the more volatile market environment",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So,this year's number is more or less at expected low levels to a large extent comprisingregular depreciation on our real estate portfolio",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"As explained in my comments on life and health, derivative valuation was negative",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, theoverall return on investment was 2",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
9% and we expect to achieve a higher return than ourinitial full year expectation of roughly 2,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
4%,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Unrealized gains, as you can see here, decreased by around EUR500 million, mainly dueto the increase in interest rates that are compared to year-end 2020",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On the next slide, well known, I think the asset allocation developed in line with ourstrategy",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The most notable change is the reallocation from government bonds intocorporate bonds,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The focus here is on large and small corporates in developed markets,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
The contributions to ordinary investments income is diversified as usual,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" The highlight asmentioned is probably the recovery in the contribution from private equity to the stronglevels we had seen before the market volatility, caused by the pandemic",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"To conclude my remarks, the first nine months and in particularly, the third quarter provedto be a challenging period for the reinsurance industry, and therefore, the overall resultand the fact that we have confirmed our full year profit guidance for 2021 highlightsHannover Re's strong ability to manage and absorb volatility",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On that note, I'd hand back to you Jean-Jacques for the comments on the outlook",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Thank you very much, Clemens",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" On the next slide, the target metrics confirms Clemens'summary",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Most notably, our main profitability target for the group, the return on equity iswell above our minimum target, even though the underwriting results in both P&C and lifeand health are impacted by extraordinary losses",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 This also means that the EBIT growthtargets in P&C and life and health are somewhat distorted by COVID claims,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Thesetargets being more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the strategiccycle,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"More importantly, growth is significantly ahead of the strategic target, providing a strongbasis for a successful business development in 2022",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"So, before we move on to the outlook for next year, let's have a brief look at ourguidance for the year 2021",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As mentioned, the profit guidance remains unchanged",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Thinking about the individual components contributing to this number, the premiumgrowth is stronger than initially expected, and together with a higher return oninvestment, this should be sufficient to compensate for higher-than-expected large lossesin P&C and higher-than-expected COVID losses in life and health, which were also partlyoffset by positive one-off effect as we've seen",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"For the fourth quarter, further impacts from COVID claims is likely in life and health",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Eventhough the development of the pandemic remains uncertain, the accelerating vaccinationprogress in South Africa in particular provides the basis for decreasing excess mortality inthis country",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The targeted ordinary dividend according to our new definition ascommunicated at our Investors Day is at least the EUR4,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
5 paid out this year,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As before, wewill consider paying a special dividend on top of this if the capitalization exceeds ourcapital requirements for future growth and profit targets are achieved",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And as of today,I'd say that both sides of trend are being met",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"As usual, at this time of the year, we publish our guidance for the expectations for nextyear, as mentioned, growth opportunities are attractive, and we therefore, expect grossreturn premium to increase by at least 5%",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" As in previous years, the growth is likely to bemore pronounced in P&C reinsurance",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The return on investment should be at least 2,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"3%,the 10 basis points being -- decrease being -- versus our initial guidance for this year,reflecting the low interest rate environment with reinvestment deals below our portfolioyield",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
The group net income is expected to be within the range of EUR1,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
4 billion to EUR1,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"5billion, an underlying improvement of around EUR250 million compared to our guidancefor this year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" The main driver for the improvement is the profitable growth in this andprevious years, in particular in P&C reinsurance",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And this growth is not only leading to animproved underwriting result, it has additionally led to a very positive cash flow, which inturn forms the basis for the favorable growth in assets under own management",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 And theincreased asset base is expected to more than compensate for the slight reduction inrelative returns,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"In life and health, growth is similarly helpful, but the profitability is also expected toimprove",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The uncertainty in life and health is somewhat higher due to the futuredevelopment of the COVID-19 pandemic,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And with this in mind, we have added adisclaimer to the effect that no material COVID lost is -- are included in the guidance",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"In addition, we have not included any potential relief from our mortality rate for cover,which is likely to payout in 2022",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, there is some allowance for COVID claims embeddedin our guidance, but no significant numbers",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Apart from this, the guidance is under the usual provisor the large losses stayed within thebudget in P&C",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 And the budget has increased to EUR1,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
3 billion,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And of course, also thatthere are no major distortions in the capital market",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The increased large loss budget ismainly a reflection of business growth,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Last but not least, the dividend policy is the sameas -- for this year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The ordinary dividend announced in March 2022 will be our floor for theordinary dividend and we have a potential special dividend on top,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Altogether, ourguidance reflects the positive development and successful cycle management of thegroup and we're quite positive about the outlook for next year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
This concludes my remarks,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And as always, we would be happy to answer your questions",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Questions And AnswersThank you,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address thelongevity release",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Yes,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible)-- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So,there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount thatwe've seen this year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Thank you,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Thank you, Vinit",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status andcredit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Clemens Jungsthof elYes, Vinit",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Good morning,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Let's start with the Solvency I,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, it's really as Jean-Jacquesmentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, if wewould be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on thebasis of Q2 of 250 roughly",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 It's the usualexercise that we do in Q3,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growththat we've seen in this year",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle forthe next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected newbusiness both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reasonwhy the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Again, it's theusual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as wespeak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, inQ4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" What is probably also worthmentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to abit more alternative investments, et cetera",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 I think that has also contributed to an SCRincrease,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at ournew business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then inthe next quarter",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Well, it's a question of market share",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Given that our subsidiary for the German business,the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Ourmarket share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but alsothe NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the UnitedStates, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Yes,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking thosereinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effectinto 2022 from reinstatement premiums",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 I don't have any precise numbers for you on howhigh exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, ratherthan speculating, I guess we will have to come back to you on that",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Yes,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 That's absolutely correct,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to ourown calculation",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will dothe calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Sothat will take some time in 2022 before this information is available,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" But according to ourown calculation, we are getting close to 113% now",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Sorry, Thomas",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Thank you,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth inP&C, Sven you can add there again",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"On P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?Vinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which mightexplain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of theunderlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and thesecond quarter and less in the third quarter",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" But then on top of that, I think the investmentresult on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainlyattributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And then, we have thementioned derivative in the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
K,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 results and that is -- that was a deviation in the thirdquarter of roughly EUR10 million,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So overall, that should round up the picture probably",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Clemens Jungsthof elBut definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeksand even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if thathas nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will bereported as a COVID claim in many countries",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 That doesn't happen,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 So I don't really relyon this analysis,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Definitely not on a quarterly basis,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And then, could you just repeat yourquestion on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?I think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million toEUR80 million stemming out of South Africa",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 So that was the bulk,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" And I think, it's probablya bit higher number than you assume for the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,wasn't it in life and health in the U",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
S,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"Well, thank you very much for joining, and thank you for the great questions",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 I think wecovered the ground very well,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" You've seen a year impacted by large losses on bothbusiness segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, theROE above 10%",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has beenconfirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 The guidance for '22 shows boththe growth trajectory of the company and the improved quality of the book,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
" So, I think thekey messages were addressed today",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
 Thank you very much for all the questions and seeyou next time,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
,Jean-Jacques Henchoz
Hi,Andrew Ritchie
" Good morning, everyone",Andrew Ritchie
" Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased catbudget for 2022, the EUR1",Andrew Ritchie
3 billion,Andrew Ritchie
" Because you split that between man-made andNatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21",Andrew Ritchie
" I guess I'm justcurious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growthor is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talkabout it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volumeversus anything else going on?My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color",Andrew Ritchie
" I'mjust trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, beforewe'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to updateagain unreleased further PADs",Andrew Ritchie
" If there's something, it could be that much of a gapbetween when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flowfrom cedents",Andrew Ritchie
 Thanks,Andrew Ritchie
Sure,Andrew Ritchie
Great,Andrew Ritchie
 Thanks very much,Andrew Ritchie
 Thank you,Andrew Ritchie
,Andrew Ritchie
Yes,Sven Althoff
" With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versusNatCat",Sven Althoff
" So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021",Sven Althoff
"So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1",Sven Althoff
3 billion is manmade and EUR1,Sven Althoff
050 billion is the natural catastrophe,Sven Althoff
 The growth is not a proxy for ourpremium growth ambitions for next year,Sven Althoff
" As always, it is the mix between the growth wehave seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our majorloss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipatedgrowth we expect for next year",Sven Althoff
The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related,Sven Althoff
" There's only a smallerportion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we arevalidating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three tofour years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of thatis flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022",Sven Althoff
"The credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positiverunoff from old underwriting years",Sven Althoff
" We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level ofinsolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runofffor the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that wenow had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus",Sven Althoff
" So, the short-termlevel of insolvencies were below our original assumptions",Sven Althoff
And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long,Sven Althoff
" So, three to five years, we couldnow release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years",Sven Althoff
"When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and thenet is relatively high",Sven Althoff
" This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both ourtransactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, whichexplains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, thebulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually thedifference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting",Sven Althoff
" So, EUR180 million out ofthat gap is coming from our fronting activities",Sven Althoff
" So, on Ida, we had -- we have booked Krecoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position",Sven Althoff
" And on thewinter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoffin the third quarter, which is due to the very late reporting from ceding companies on thatfreeze loss",Sven Althoff
" So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting andcapacity for construction in the U",Sven Althoff
S,Sven Althoff
", the reporting is slower compared to the usualreporting periods",Sven Althoff
" We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we shouldhave seen the full impact of winter storm Uri with this third quarter figures",Sven Althoff
Yes,Sven Althoff
" As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for ourexpected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year",Sven Althoff
" From a process pointof view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like weare doing now",Sven Althoff
" So, the EUR1",Sven Althoff
3 billion is fixed for 2022,Sven Althoff
" Same, of course, goes for the EUR1",Sven Althoff
1billion we fixed for 2021,Sven Althoff
" And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect apremium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were moreexpecting a growth in the 5% to 7",Sven Althoff
5% range,Sven Althoff
" So, a good part of the increase in the majorloss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022",Sven Althoff
"As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%on the P&C side",Sven Althoff
" But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average Igave you during the Investors Day, i",Sven Althoff
e,Sven Althoff
", the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeksago, rather than the 14% after three quarters",Sven Althoff
" By the way, the growth number will comeslightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the fullyear",Sven Althoff
" The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset onour biggest structured contract, we have increased our share",Sven Althoff
" So, there was a significantpremium entry booked in the third quarter",Sven Althoff
" But under that contract, we every year toohave the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there willbe a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on thatparticular contract",Sven Althoff
 And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%rather than staying at the 14,Sven Althoff
"5%, where we are after three quarters",Sven Althoff
,Sven Althoff
Okay,Klaus Miller
" Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side",Klaus Miller
 The way how it works aswe -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pensioninsurer,Klaus Miller
" And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at theforefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting",Klaus Miller
"So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do thatand they have to change their systems to administer that",Klaus Miller
" And that takes usually at least ayear, sometimes two, sometimes even more",Klaus Miller
"We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible)and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we getat least annual update",Klaus Miller
" Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes wehave to ask for it",Klaus Miller
" So, a delay of two years is probably the norm",Klaus Miller
"And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixedlag, which is fixed from the outset",Klaus Miller
 We know exactly these numbers,Klaus Miller
 They don't even haveto send it to us,Klaus Miller
" And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have topay",Klaus Miller
" And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag",Klaus Miller
 We know thatthe treaty is basically going according to plan,Klaus Miller
" And then, we just book these numbers",Klaus Miller
"What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same assomebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000",Klaus Miller
" So, in the monthlyaccounts, you don't see a difference",Klaus Miller
" But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot ofthese claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher thanif somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,much shorter",Klaus Miller
"And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especiallywriting new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the(inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start getting this up todate and again this year",Klaus Miller
 And you can expect this for the future,Klaus Miller
" If we don't update the(inaudible) and release the PADs as Clemens mentioned earlier, you should expect ourprofits are improving from year-to-year in small -- very small set",Klaus Miller
 And then only as soon aswe take the (inaudible) and clean up for the people who have died more than expected,Klaus Miller
"And obviously, we can release all the provisions for adverse deviations for these deadpeople because we definitely don't need it",Klaus Miller
 Then you will see a big profit like you see thisyear,Klaus Miller
 This should happen regularly every two or three years,Klaus Miller
"But just to make one point clear, this is not a new assumption setting for mortality in thefuture",Klaus Miller
 This is cleaning up the portfolio for people who have died,Klaus Miller
" And therefore, clearly,we don't need to pass any long term",Klaus Miller
No,Klaus Miller
 Not at all,Klaus Miller
 That's not what I was saying or trying to say at least,Klaus Miller
" When it comes to theGerman business, we hardly do any fronting",Klaus Miller
" So, the difference on burnt between grossand net, is really our own retro sessions",Klaus Miller
" So, the gross number you are seeing is alsoalmost exclusively our own writing",Klaus Miller
 that situation is different on an Ida,Klaus Miller
 The U,Klaus Miller
S,Klaus Miller
 portfolio isthe peak portfolio in our fronting activities,Klaus Miller
" So, therefore out of the EUR527 million ofgross, approximately EUR180 million is fronted business, where -- while on burnt, it isalmost zero",Klaus Miller
Okay,Klaus Miller
 Let's start with the growth on the life and health side,Klaus Miller
" We are quite optimistic thatwe are growing, but most of that will be -- and this is where our focus is on the bottomline, it's not on the top line",Klaus Miller
" Top line happened every now and then, and you have tounderstand there are basically three ways to grow the top line here",Klaus Miller
"On the -- either we really write new large blocks of business, that will increase top line ormost of our treaties on the mortality side -- morbidity side are via treaties, and as thesetreaties get older, that mortality rates, morbidity rates grow exponentially",Klaus Miller
" So, the riskpremium grows, even if nothing happens, even if no new policies are added, thesetreaties grow for the existing portfolio, because we have risk premiums, which aregrowing",Klaus Miller
"Of course, at some point in time, this goes the other way, because in 50 years all thesetreaties have runoff",Klaus Miller
" But as long as they are still young, 10, 15, sorry -- 10, 15 years old",Klaus Miller
These treaties are growing,Klaus Miller
" And then, of course, we have treaties, which are open fornew business, and this is another source of growth",Klaus Miller
" So, in general, we expect to reach the5% maybe a little bit more, but this mainly depends on large block transactions, especiallyon one of our focus areas",Klaus Miller
 And that is longevity,Klaus Miller
"Then your question on the retro, yes, it kicks in at 110% population mortality",Klaus Miller
" And that isthe, as mentioned earlier by Clemens, it's a weighted average of the U",Klaus Miller
S,Klaus Miller
", UK, andAustralian population mortality, weighted with the portfolio of Hannover Re",Klaus Miller
"So, we try to get the correlation between this parametric cover and the results in our ownportfolio as high as possible",Klaus Miller
" So, we tried to optimize that by using our own portfoliostructure to define the parametric cover",Klaus Miller
" And as I said earlier, it's currently stands close to113%, according to our own calculations",Klaus Miller
"And then, the longevity release, yes, we are, when we started 15, 20 years ago, we havelongevity and nobody else was doing that",Klaus Miller
 We embarked on a pretty conservative way ofaccounting for that,Klaus Miller
" So, in the first couple of years and this is still valid today, we only showabout 2% to 3% profit in terms of an EBIT margin",Klaus Miller
" And if the portfolio develops asexpected, we would see and you've seen that now a release of these PADs especiallywhen we do these cleanup of portfolio",Klaus Miller
" With COVID, especially in the U",Klaus Miller
K,Klaus Miller
", we got the -U",Klaus Miller
K,Klaus Miller
" is the largest market, we had a lot of claims and most of these claims have not beenaccounted for fully, because the release you have seen probably only includes theupdated portfolio information 12 months ago",Klaus Miller
" So, an awful lot of COVID is still not in there",Klaus Miller
That is something what we hope to release sometime in the future as soon as we knowthat we have valid data for that from the clients,Klaus Miller
Yes,Klaus Miller
" On burned, Vinit, you know that we have placed a little over EUR300 million of wholeaccounts coverage",Klaus Miller
" So, you should think about burned in the terms of being a substantialpartial loss against our whole account cover",Klaus Miller
 I would not be comfortable to give you theprecise split for the simple reason that the loss happened in the quarter,Klaus Miller
"So therefore, we have not received enough information yet to book each and everyelement of the loss on the bottom-up basis",Klaus Miller
" So, there are still some top-downassumptions included in our gross number for burned",Klaus Miller
" And depending on how that will fallin the end on individual contracts, the split between K and whole account is subject tochange",Klaus Miller
" So, whatever (inaudible) split, I would give you today, would be subject to thatchange",Klaus Miller
" So therefore, I would feel uncomfortable to giving you very precise numbers",Klaus Miller
" Butas I said, you should think about burned as a substantial partial loss against our wholeaccount structure with the remainder going to K",Klaus Miller
"And on the NatCat, so as Jean-Jacques explained in the Q&A, during the Investors Day, ofthe NatCat portfolio is modeling well against our profitability hurdle rate",Klaus Miller
" So, from pricingpoint of view, the last two rounds of rate increases certainly helped to get that portfolio toa better level of profitability",Klaus Miller
 We expect further rate increases on the loss impactedbusiness into 2022,Klaus Miller
" So, from that point of view, we are okay with our profitability on theNatCat side, but at the same time, as we already mentioned on the Investors Day, we willkeep our relative risk appetite for NatCat stable nonetheless",Klaus Miller
" We are not seeing ratesyet, which would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite",Klaus Miller
"On the result point of view, I'm afraid, I don't have those numbers for you",Klaus Miller
" The NatCat isnot a separate segment we are reporting upon, as you know, for few quarters now",Klaus Miller
" So, Iwould not be able to give you those numbers, but Claude can get back to you on those",Klaus Miller
,Klaus Miller
"Hey, good morning",Vinit Malhotra
 Thank you very much,Vinit Malhotra
" So, a few questions please if I can",Vinit Malhotra
" First is that,I'm noticing, I mean, you're talking about Solvency FTR growth, but I can't seem torecollect that, it was there, for example, similar period last year, might have been, but wedidn't really mention it",Vinit Malhotra
 The growth was similar,Vinit Malhotra
" So, I just wanted to know, is there anythingmore remarkable in that number? And this is more a quick check really",Vinit Malhotra
Second question is on the combined ratios in credit,Vinit Malhotra
 I think I can back calculate 3Q is about73%,Vinit Malhotra
" Now, remember that we keep talking about how the economic recovery andinsolvency in state schemes going away",Vinit Malhotra
 Is there any reserve movement here or anythingmore notable please?Just one more question on retro please,Vinit Malhotra
" The bond recovery is very, very high",Vinit Malhotra
" I mean 240net growth, 643, I think is one of the very strong recoveries for a single loss",Vinit Malhotra
" Could youcomment on that? With also some comments please on Texas freeze?And just lastly, please, the cash flow of EUR1",Vinit Malhotra
"5 billion is very, very high, very high as far asme",Vinit Malhotra
" You mentioned investment income, the roads and the business, but is there anythingmore remarkable, for instance, I mean, there would also be payouts to be made on theseEUR1 billion plus of losses",Vinit Malhotra
" Would that be affecting cash flows in the future as well? So, Ijust wanted to understand the cash flow well? Thank you very much",Vinit Malhotra
Yeah,Vinit Malhotra
 Thank you,Vinit Malhotra
Okay,Vinit Malhotra
" Thanks, Sven",Vinit Malhotra
Yes,Vinit Malhotra
 Thank you for the opportunity,Vinit Malhotra
" Sorry to ask again, but on the life side, I mean, I'm justcurious about a few things please",Vinit Malhotra
"One is that, if I just start with the operated -- the reported EBIT of EUR41 million, and addback COVID mortality data, the longevity is at EUR83 million",Vinit Malhotra
" And then somewhere fromthe presentation, I picked up that financials -- the deposit accounting was also EUR95million",Vinit Malhotra
" So, ex deposit accounting, we actually have a loss of about EUR12 million",Vinit Malhotra
 And I'vebeen made aware that there are some derivatives which went up against in the financial -in the financial statement,Vinit Malhotra
" I mean, is there anything that you could comment on thissurprisingly negative result on the life side, please? That's really my question",Vinit Malhotra
"And second question is, on this cover on the pandemic, I think there was a conversationalso in the 2Q results, where it was mentioned that the cover wasn't being activated yet,because of Australian mortality trends, if I recollect",Vinit Malhotra
" Has that changed? Or is there someupdate on that, that makes you think that next year you could choose this cover?And last follow-up is on getting a question from (inaudible) is there any idea to break outthis burned between (inaudible) and the whole account, please? Thank you",Vinit Malhotra
Clemens Jungsthof elOkay,Vinit Malhotra
 The first question was the EBIT,Vinit Malhotra
" I fully understand that you do a little bit of, let's say,recalculation, take a few things out and add others back in, but the COVID reporting ofCOVID claims is, let's say, at least very delayed, if not completely unreliable",Vinit Malhotra
" So, makingcalculations especially on the quarterly basis, what the usual number would be, it's quitedifficult",Vinit Malhotra
" We don't get correct information from all our clients, and we definitely don't get itin time",Vinit Malhotra
" So, adding or subtracting COVID claims from, let's say, audited claims numbers is-- it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I would not necessarily rely on the outcome here",Vinit Malhotra
"I can't see that we have a negative -- of course, we have a negative results if you look atthe COVID claims on mortality side, it's highly negative, but we have a very stable financialsolutions result",Vinit Malhotra
" What you have seen in the other result here is the 351, of which 278 isdeposit accounting treaties and they are completely unaffected by COVID",Vinit Malhotra
" We also havevery positive longevity result, plus even if you ignore the one-off of nearly EUR100 million,which is also only slightly positive impacted by COVID",Vinit Malhotra
" And the EUR400 million COVIDclaims, of course, drag it down, but the underlying profitability is extremely high andstable",Vinit Malhotra
 The great unknown for us is how the next COVID variant will develop in '22,Vinit Malhotra
 Andnobody can tell you anything about that,Vinit Malhotra
"As the life pandemic cover was already running at a higher and I think at 2Q, you had saidthat you were not yet counting it in or factoring it because of Australian mortality claims",Vinit Malhotra
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing,Vinit Malhotra
 But maybe -- yes,Vinit Malhotra
Clemens Jungsthof elThe cover is for all three countries in total,Vinit Malhotra
" So, it's a parametric cover and this stands at100 and close to 113 right now",Vinit Malhotra
" If nobody dies for the rest of the year, this will fall belowthe 110 and we don't get anything",Vinit Malhotra
 It's unlikely that we don't even see normal mortality,Vinit Malhotra
" So,I expect definitely something in -- for this year, but it will only be calculated next year,because the calculation agent relies on official statistics and official statistics, populationstatistics for 2021 will only be available sometime in 2022",Vinit Malhotra
" And sometimes it's not Januaryor February or anything like that, well the second half of the year",Vinit Malhotra
 These are civil servantswho produce that,Vinit Malhotra
"And the calculation agent will only start calculating the final recuperation for us here, assoon as he has all the official statistics from the U",Vinit Malhotra
S,Vinit Malhotra
", from Australia, from the U",Vinit Malhotra
K,Vinit Malhotra
And the EUR32 million booked in the U,Vinit Malhotra
S,Vinit Malhotra
" COVID 3Q, that looked a bit lower and thatcould be also this late supporting, Klaus, that you mentioned?That in the third quarter, the U",Vinit Malhotra
S,Vinit Malhotra
" was rather low mortality in booking of EUR32 millionversus the deaths and the excess straight were nearly EUR100,000",Vinit Malhotra
"Clemens Jungsthof elVinit, sorry, I think -- apologies, Vinit",Vinit Malhotra
 Go ahead,Vinit Malhotra
Okay,Vinit Malhotra
 Thank you very much,Vinit Malhotra
 Thank you,Vinit Malhotra
Thank you very much,Vinit Malhotra
 Appreciate it,Vinit Malhotra

"On the cash flow, nothing really significant",Unidentified Speaker

" And I think what is probably worth mentioning here, when it is the factthat we have seen very low payout ratios when it comes to our plane",Unidentified Speaker

"Hi, morning, everyone",William Hardcastle
 Just a quick follow-up on that,William Hardcastle
" So, essentially on the frontingbusiness, is what you're saying the difference between the gross and net, obviously onthe floods is bigger versus Ida",William Hardcastle
 Is that because of the greater fronting on Europeanbusiness? Is that what you're saying?Sure,William Hardcastle
 It's quite the opposite of what I was saying,William Hardcastle
" So, effectively your retro is kicking farstronger in your own account from the floods than has on Ida",William Hardcastle
 Is there anything why that'shappened? Is there a specific reason?Okay,William Hardcastle
 Moving to (inaudible) I'll go to my actual questions now,William Hardcastle
" What benefit did thereinstatement premium have in Q3 for P&C? And is this already factored in when youprovide the 2022 outlook, to say greater than 5%? And perhaps any quantification of whatthat impact is?And the second one is, you've touched on there on the 2022 guidance, no materialCOVID-19 impact in life and health",William Hardcastle
" Just for clarity, it sounds like you're not assuming zero,but certainly less than something like EUR100 million",William Hardcastle
" Is that a very fair assumption?And just on that pandemic retro cover, it sounds like you feel very confident that will payout now, is that because Q3 losses for excess mortality came in ahead of yourexpectation, that it's effectively giving greater certainty that it will kick in",William Hardcastle
 Is that how weshould read that?Brilliant,William Hardcastle
 Thank you,William Hardcastle
,William Hardcastle
Yes,Thomas Fossard
 Good morning,Thomas Fossard
 Couple of questions,Thomas Fossard
 The first one would be related to the walk fromthe '22 guidance versus 2021,Thomas Fossard
" If you could add maybe a bit of color on the underlyingassumptions you have taken? The second quick question will be, regarding COVIDscenario for 2022, I guess that you built something in into your 239% Solvency II ratioalready, given it's forward-looking in terms of calculation",Thomas Fossard
" So, would you mind sayingmaybe a range of what you're already expecting for 2022?And so, the last question would be, just to come back on the 2",Thomas Fossard
"3% return on investmentguidance for 2022, and especially knowing that you reported 2",Thomas Fossard
9% or 2,Thomas Fossard
8% ordinaryinvestment income in 2021,Thomas Fossard
" I mean, you've got the support from private equity frominflation linkers, but I'm wondering either 2",Thomas Fossard
"3% should be -- if nothing exceptionally is inthe reported nine months 2021, I'm wondering, is the 2",Thomas Fossard
3% should be compared to the2,Thomas Fossard
4% 2020 guidance or to the 2,Thomas Fossard
"8% 2021, and 2",Thomas Fossard
"3% seems to be super, super cautious,given what you achieved this year",Thomas Fossard
 Thank you,Thomas Fossard
Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Thomas Fossard
" Thomas, let's probably start with the guidance for 2022",Thomas Fossard
" So, overall, I think withoutgoing too much into the details, the core question is, where does the increase in netincome mainly stem from",Thomas Fossard
 It's clearly a mix of effect,Thomas Fossard
" In the bottom line, first of all, ofcourse, the significant business growth that we've seen both in P&C -- in life and healthand in P&C, the quality of the book should have increased over the last couple of years",Thomas Fossard
"So, we will certainly increase -- we'll see an increase of profitability and in P&C here andthere",Thomas Fossard
" And of course, the overall amount of the growth will be reflected in higher EBITnumbers in P&C",Thomas Fossard
" On the life and health book, as mentioned earlier, the expectation is thatwe will see significant less COVID-19 claims in the life and health segment",Thomas Fossard
" So, theunderlying profitability of the business should come through in 2022",Thomas Fossard
 That will be anotherlarge contributor,Thomas Fossard
"On the investment side, I think, yes, when you look at the numbers, they do seem verycautious for 2022",Thomas Fossard
" We are optimistic that we will at least reach that number, the 2",Thomas Fossard
"3%, butI'm just conscious of the fact, of course, that we've seen sort of a rebound in thecontribution from alternative investment, that amount has been significant",Thomas Fossard
" I think roughlyEUR100 million of our ordinary income is only related to an increase compared to last yearof the contribution of alternative investments, mainly private equity",Thomas Fossard
" So, I wouldn't reallyfactor that in going forward for every year",Thomas Fossard
" I think that did come a bit as a surprise for me,to be honest, also the valuations on the private equity side, which have increasedsignificantly",Thomas Fossard
" So, I wouldn't really want to expect that amount for 2022",Thomas Fossard
"Inflation-linked bonds, the same picture there",Thomas Fossard
" We have seen a huge contribution,probably EUR100 million more this year as well, compared to last year, given the currentinflation environment and the way the amortization of our inflation-linked bonds work",Thomas Fossard
" So,there are two -- at least two effects in the ordinary already, that we will see to someextent in next year, but we have been a bit more cautious on that end",Thomas Fossard
"On Solvency II, if I got the question right, Thomas, but please add",Thomas Fossard
" So, how much from theSCR increase would we attribute to our growth in 2022? I don't have the exact number",Thomas Fossard
"But I think overall, it's certainly on the Solvency II ratio, probably a double digit -- lowdouble-digit number, or a high single-digit, a low double-digit number that is attributableto that effect",Thomas Fossard
 But again --Yes,Thomas Fossard
" I think, Clemens, I was more thinking about the prospective COVID-19 mortalitylosses that you are expecting to incur in 2022, which may already be reflected into yourSolvency II ratio at Q3",Thomas Fossard
Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Thomas Fossard
" No, that is not -- I don't think that is included in the SCR and in the own funds yet",Thomas Fossard
" Wewill do an update of that planning and the effect I think in the fourth quarter, but it's notreflected",Thomas Fossard
 But it wouldn't be in a substantial amount as mentioned earlier anyways,Thomas Fossard
Yes,Thomas Fossard
Yes,Thomas Fossard
 Two quick questions,Thomas Fossard
" The first one would be on the life reside, this longevity PAD",Thomas Fossard
" Iguess it was included in your EUR600 million EBIT contribution initially targeted for 2023and that you move to 2024, but just wanted to -- I guess it was included at the time of theInvestor Day",Thomas Fossard
" But just wanted to update on that, just to be fully aligned and fully clear",Thomas Fossard
 Andthe second question would be on the P&C side or P&C NatCat,Thomas Fossard
 What's your overallassessment of the profitability of your book? Maybe you could share with us the year-todate combined ratio or the return on allocated capital you're getting on this book despiterunning ahead of budget? Thank you,Thomas Fossard
Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Thomas Fossard
" Thomas, this is indeed taking into account the longevity and benefits also that -that's including the EUR600 million",Thomas Fossard
Thank you,Thomas Fossard
 Thank you,Thomas Fossard
,Thomas Fossard
Hi,Iain Pearce
 Thanks for taking my questions,Iain Pearce
 The first one is just on the growth numbers,Iain Pearce
" When welook at the impact on the Solvency II ratio and the increase in the cat budget, theimplication is probably that growth is going to be significantly ahead of 5% especially inP&C rates",Iain Pearce
" So firstly, do you think that's a fair assumption?And then secondly, is there anything in terms of life and health growth that you're thinkingis going to be lower, that's leading you to maintain that 5% growth target? The secondone was just a quick clarification, the life retro kicks in, is it a 100% excess of normalmortality that the trigger for that parametric cover?And then, the third one was just on longevity releases and the potential for these goingforward",Iain Pearce
" Sort of -- you sort of cautioned us against factoring in too much here, but if youthink -- if I thinking in sort of your key longevity markets, mortality has been trendingfavorably consistently over the last couple of years before we even factor in any impactsfrom COVID",Iain Pearce
 Why should we not be thinking that these are going to be some -- there'sgoing to be continued favorable longevity development?Perfect,Iain Pearce
 Thank you,Iain Pearce
,Iain Pearce
Good morning,Darius Satkauskas
 Thank you for taking my questions,Darius Satkauskas
" So, your Solvency II ratio have declined11 percentage points since the end of July",Darius Satkauskas
" Could you tell us how many Solvency II pointsdid the expected growth account for? And then, is this capturing the next 12 months? So,the 4Q 2022 as well or -- sorry, is it capturing the next 12 months or the entire 2022?And then lastly, do you have a comparable figure for last year, because if I look at theSolvency II decline in 3Q 2020 relative to 1H '20, it's much less pronounced",Darius Satkauskas
" So, yes, couldyou give us a comparable figure if possible? Thank you",Darius Satkauskas
Clemens Jungsthof elYes,Darius Satkauskas
