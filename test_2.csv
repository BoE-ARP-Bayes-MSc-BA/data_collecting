"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Hannover Re InternationalConference Call on Interim Results 1/2015. For your information, this conference is beingrecorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. UlrichWallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to ourconference call presenting our results for the first quarter of 2015. As always, I'm joined byour CFO, Roland Vogel. Given that today is also the date of our annual general meeting ofour shareholders, we are holding this call rather early.I've also heard that one of our competitors is reporting today as well so we will try to berather punctual and finish at around 10:15 to give you the opportunity, if you wish so, to doother things. With this in mind, Roland and I will try to keep our comments as brief aspossible to make sure that we have sufficient time left over for the Q&A session.I'm pleased to report that Hannover Re had an excellent start into the year 2015 with agroup net income of €280 million, an increase of 20% and a gross written premiumgrowth of 10% on a ForEx adjusted basis, the first quarter has seen a successful first stepto achieving our full-year guidance. This is especially gratifying against the backdrop ofcontinued difficult environment for the international reinsurers, in particular, due to thefierce competition mainly on the P&C side as well as the continued challenges that arepresented to ourselves by the very low interest rate.The very good profitability of the first quarter is based on excellent results of our Life &Health reinsurance business and continued good underwriting results of our Property &Casualty business. At 13.9%, we were, again, able to achieve an attractive return on equitydespite the fact that the shareholders' equity is further grown by roughly €1 billion to now€8.5 billion.This is the result of the retained high earnings as well as currency effect, as you know, withthe change of the functional currency of our Bermuda subsidiary, we have increased theU.S. dollar component in our capital and that is, of course, felt in the OCI and is thedecreasing interest rates in the first quarter we also had growing valuation reserves.The book value per share reached a new all-time high of €70.68. Following threeconsecutive years of low (03:40) major losses, very good results in the industries, theproperty & casualty reinsurance market continues to see fierce competition with thecapacity exceeding the demand from ceding companies by quite a margin.However, the amount of quality business you've seen so far towards the end of 2014 andin 2015 has actually been a little bit better than we had expected. Although we continue toadhere systematically to our selective underwriting approach, our Property & Casualtybusiness has grown on a gross premium basis, currency adjusted, by 13%. This is mainlydriven by new business from emerging markets, particularly China, the U.S. and also quitesignificant growth on our agricultural business.We also had a special effect with a more accurate estimating of premiums and ouraccounting of the facultative business, which led to a non-recurring additional premium ofapproximately €93 million for the first quarter. However, even eliminating the fact we wereable to grow the gross premium of our P&C business currency adjusted by about 8%.This figure shows that we have made a highly successful start into the year 2015. With ahealthy operating profit of €255 million and a combined ratio of 95.7%, our Property &Casualty business continues to be quite profitable. This is then particularly true as wewere able to keep with our conservative loss reserving policy also in the first quarter ofthe current year.We are thoroughly satisfied with the development of our Life & Health business. Thecurrency adjusted premium growth of around 7% is at the upper range of our target.Opportunities presented themselves in the emerging markets in the Australian groupbusiness as well as the block assumption transactions of our longevity business inparticular from the UK. The significant improved results show that the steps taken toimprove the profitability of our Australian (60:40) disability portfolio throughout to someextent of our U.S. mortality business makes themselves felt.On top of the good underlying profitability, we saw a significant additional profit of around€39 million from termination fee of a financial solution transaction which had been bookedas a derivative and, therefore, will appear in the line of ordinary investment income.Altogether, the operating profit showed a remarkable increase to reach €173 million, animpressive increase of 165% compared with last year's figure.We're also satisfied with the development of our investments. Also interest ratescontinued to move lower. Our ordinary income from the fixed income securities as well asour real estate portfolio had increased remarkably. This is on the back of largeshareholdings because also the invested assets have again increased significantly, notleast because of a continued very positive cash flow.On that note, I will hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain to you these rathergood figures in more detail.Okay. Good morning and thank, Uli. In the interest of time, I sort of immediately start withPage 2. And as already mentioned, top line growth was notably ahead of our expectationsin the first quarter with regard to the very impressive currency exchange rate impact, onehas to bear in mind that premiums are translated on the basis of monthly rates and 2014started into the year with a much stronger euro.Net premium earned increased by 6.9% at unchanged FX rates that is slightly less thanthe top line mainly due to our ILS activities and some fronting arrangements in the P&Creinsurance segment.Investment income, very satisfying benefiting from the positive one off in Life & Healthwhich Uli has already mentioned and which we will hear about at different occasions. Here,the fee of around €40 million became payable, owing a customer-initiated withdrawalfrom a financial solutions contract and due to the limited risk to the insurer as alreadymentioned. This contract was booked in accordance with derivative accounting and,thereby, is recognized within the investment income of the Life & Health division.Other income and expenses benefited again from positive currency exchange rate effect,this time mainly in the Life & Health reinsurance segment. Storm Niklas has hit Germanyand hereby especially E+S Rück, our German subsidiary. And on that basis, some of theselosses are borne by the minority shareholders, which is the reason for the positive swingin the minority interest line.The tax ratio is slightly above our expected level due to a rather conservative approach inrecognizing deferred tax liabilities, however, those who have already read our quarterlyreport in detail might have found in the notes that we do expect a refund of past taxpayments in Q2, which should lead to a rather low tax rate in Q2, and, overall, the full yeartax rate should be in line or even a little bit below our expectations, and those wereusually around 25%.If we look at the capital side, we have just recently announced the early redemption of a€500 million perpetual bond on the 1 June 2015. Just as a reminder, we had alreadyrefinanced this bond in September last year. So, therefore, the green part of this columnon the slide should be reduced in Q2 to a level that will likely be sustainable, and with thatalso the interest claimants will of course be reduced in the future.When it comes to shareholders' equity, last year's trend continued with an increase ofaround 13% in the first quarter of 2015. Here, especially the OCI changes driven by theasset valuations make our life more difficult when it comes to ROE achievements. Before –the background, the actual achievement of 13.9% is, from my own point of view, evenmore remarkable.Cash flow continues to be very positive, mainly fueled by the premium growth of ourreinsurance business. And it also, of course, includes currency exchange rate effects. Butalso, the investment income has contributed.Assets under own management further increased by 9.5% to a level of close to €40billion, in the meantime. The impact of currency exchange rates here, in particular, theUSD was around €2.5 billion within that numbers. Rising valuations reserves had a positiveimpact of around €260 million in the first quarter of 2015.On the P&C side of life, the gross premium increased by a remarkable 13% on an FXadjusted basis. Uli already mentioned the special effects of the changed recognition ofpipeline premium in the facultative business. Here, we have enhanced our accountingsystem to calculate more accurately what we call the pipeline premium, which is thepremium already earned, but for which we have not yet received cedant accounts. Thiseffect accounts for 5 percentage points of the reported growth for the first quarter andthis is expected to normalize over the next quarters.At 3.3% of the net premium earned major losses, again very well below the budget in thefirst quarter. The underwriting result is again on a very good level. The combined ratio of95.7% is below the full year maximum target of 96%. With the very positive overall resultin mind and in line with our practice employed in the past, we did not release the unusedlarge loss budget, but capped (14:37) it for the remainder of the year.We did also not benefit from other positive run-off results in the first quarter of 2015, pluswe have kept our reserving methodology unchanged. All in all, this means that we shouldhave kept our confidence level at minimum stable, and the absolute amounts ofredundant reserves should have been increased one more time.The very low inflation level has had a negative impact on the investment income, butother than that, the ordinary investment income and also realized gains were in line withexpectations. Other income and expenses in this segment are on a similar levelcompared to last year. All together, net income from our P&C business stands at €171million, very satisfying even if a little bit below a very good previous quarter or Q1 2014.On the next slide, you can see that most lines of business showed good underwritingprofitability. Continental Europe was mainly affected by Storm Niklas at the very end of thisquarter, while aviation was impacted by the Germanwings loss, plus a few single losseswhich did not make it over the large loss threshold, but still added to the negativecombined ratio effect. Marine is only slightly above the MtCR. This can be explained by theincreased basic losses in the first quarter and a cargo ship carrying rather expensive carsthat went aground in January, but didn't really make it to a single large loss. Notsurprisingly, the profitability of our global cat business was very good due to the absenceof the cat losses.I think we can go through the next slides rather quickly, because as already mentioned,major losses well below the average in the budget. Still, the year has only just begun.Three losses made it on to our large loss list, apart from the already mentioned events,the winter storm in the U.S. just crossed the €10 million threshold and, overall, the bulk ofour €95 million in unused budget as already mentioned has been carried forward for theremainder of the year as IBNR.With currency adjusted growth of 6.5%, the premium development as well as the growingbusiness segments in our Life & Health business lines us very much in line with our targets.The important message here is that the underlying profitability has improved as we hadexpected.On top of this improvement, the result benefited from the already mentioned one-offeffect in the ordinary investment income as well as the occurrence of positive currencyexchange rate effects in other income and expenses. Overall, this results in a remarkableoperating profit of €173 million for the first quarter.This excellent result is also reflected in the EBIT margins for our reporting currencies,which all outperformed their respective targets with the financial solutions segment, ofcourse, benefiting also from the run-off. But even without these non-recurring itemsprofitability, it was very, very positive. As a sideline, the effect from our ModCo derivativeswas around zero in the first quarter.Looking at the investments, I'm quite satisfied with the results of the first quarter 2015despite the low-yield environment or even lower-yield environment. And excluding thespecial effect in the Life & Health segment, the ordinary investment in turn is still abovethe last year's level based on the increased asset volume. Of course, this development isalso supported by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Mainly as a result of regular portfolio maintenance realized gains were on a lower, but stillremarkable level. Depreciations were again only on a very, very low level, consisting forthe most part of regular depreciation from our increasing real estate portfolio.Excluding the effects of the technical derivatives, meaning ModCo and inflation swaps, theROI from assets under own management was 3.5%, clearly above the expectation andleaving us well placed to achieve our target for the full year. If we adjust that for the oneoff, the ROI would have been 3.2%, still clearly above the target of exactly 3%.Moreover, we have switched our targeted inflation protection from swaps to inflationlinked bonds. And our last tranche of the swaps is maturing in the second quarter. So inthe future, this should mitigate the artificial volatility we have seen from these instrumentsin the past.Our asset allocation is almost unchanged and for this reason, you can find the respectiveslide in the appendix to these presentations. And again, in the interest of time, I wouldconclude my remarks here and leave the rest to Uli.Thank you, Roland. It's a pleasure for me this quarter to present the target matrixbecause, for a change, all targets have been achieved, which is evident of a very goodfirst quarter 2015. This also suggests that we have laid a good foundation for achievingour full-year targets.Therefore, I will move directly to the outlook on the next slide. We have actually beenquite satisfied with the renewals at 1st of April on the P&C side where business in Japan istraditionally renewed, and alongside with that, some business from Australia and NewZealand, as well as part of the U.S. property catastrophe and some other U.S. business. Inaddition, also some of our agricultural business was up for renewal. Overall, we recordeda premium growth of 5%, which, of course, as always is on a currency-adjusted basis. Andwe achieved that without making concessions to our underwriting discipline.This increase is actually largely driven by some new business that we wrote in the U.S.where we actually managed to write some quite attractive new short-tail treaty. Also inJapan, we managed to increase our volume to some extent, and that is despite the factthat on the property catastrophe business, we saw continued pressure on the rates.In personal accident and property per risk, the price declines were for the most partactually quite small, and based of some losses in the past, on the casualty business, weindeed actually saw some increases. Overall, we managed to improve our provision,particularly some of our core clients and this is the reason that the opportunities that weat Hannover Re saw in the Japanese market have actually been quite positive at thisrenewal.On the property catastrophe in the U.S., we saw the – it's too difficult for me to sayexpected decrease, but nonetheless, it's a decrease of 5% to 10%. We saw anotherincreasing showing of that business to Hannover Re and, therefore, due to some businessreason, the premium volume actually increased slightly at 5% that actually rates havecome down. But we continue to underwrite rates which meet our requirement for beingwell excess the expected loss plus expenses plus cost of capital.Given the result of the first quarter, largely supporting our guidance, we have left theguidance more or less unchanged. This, however, is no entirely true for the expectedgrowth because the successful start in the year, which will, of course, have continuedeffects on the premiums booked in the later quarters, we are now more confident thatactually we will achieve an increase of our volume, both in Property & Casualty as well as inLife & Health.We left the target of 875% (sic) [€875 million] (25:30) for the profits for the entire yearunchanged despite the fact that we have made quite a way in the first quarter, but theyear is long and lots of things can happen. So, we felt it will be prudent to keep thatguidance unchanged for the time being.Well the dividend, you can see is our normal 35% to 40%. This allows us, of course, tofinance our inspired growth internally. However, if the market remains unchanged and thecapital develops as we have seen in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, of course, higherdividends are actually quite likely.Looking at the individual areas of our Property & Casualty business, we are quite confidentthat we will still be able to achieve margins above the cost of capital and this is despitethe intensive competition. However, we have seen that our Property & Casualty practice ispositioned to be successful even in this rather competitive phase of the market.We see potential for further growth, in particular, in North America and Asia-Pacific, butalso in our facultative business and, in particular, our structured reinsurance business andwe, it's already certain, we'll see quite remarkable growth of our agricultural business.While the volume, the arrows you see here is a little bit more positive because they arenot on a currency adjusted basis. So, a large part of those arrows are actually currency.On the Life & Health business, similarly, we expect 2015 will be better than 2014 andoverall, can see a very good result. You can see that we expect negative premium growthon our financial solutions business, however, premium on financial solutions is not thatdecisive because a lot of the transactions are actually booked on a deposit basis. Andeven as we have observed to some extent as a derivative therefore are not shown up inthe premium line at all. On the financial solution business, of course, it's the mostimportant development of the bottom line. And here, we are very confident that we willsee a very impressive growth in 2015.The areas of longevity business we expect to grow. I mean, there's a continued demandof tailor-made solutions which actually allow us to grow that business. Mortality business,despite the continued negative repercussion from our ING portfolio, overall actually, it'squite profitable. And for the morbidity business, we see improvements in Australiaparticularly in the group business due to the significant rate increase.Therefore, all in all, we are quite positive on our Life & Health business for the currentyear. This slide looks familiar to you because it really shows where we see the strength ofHannover Re and the current competitive business that reinsurance presents for us inchallenging investment environment. And this is actually quite continuous for the lastcouple of years.For the Life & Health business, I think, a lot has been said. Needless to say that it is quitegratifying that we see increased profits from our Life & Health business at a time when wesee a lot of pressure on the P&C business from competition as the diversification workswell here. As for as the Property & Casualty business is consumed, our franchise is intact.We, in our position as one of the large multinational, multi-line (30:47) reinsurers seegood opportunities on that business, and we can also that way safeguard the quality ofour business.So far, we also could keep the very conservative loss reserving policy as the result overallhas been good. And that gives us quite a reassuring buffer also into the coming year.Investment income, cash flow continues to be positive. We continue to keep the absolutereturn on a stable level as the relative returns there on investments, 3%. We actually are alittle bit better than that. So, overall, the story is intact.On that note ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of our presentation covering thestart, which was actually quite good into 2015 and we will be more than happy to answeryour questions.Q&A",Operator,0.32,2021-11-04,past,"['good', 'morning', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'todays', 'hannover', 'internationalconference', 'interim', 'conference', 'beingrecorded', 'time',

"The first question comes from Mr. In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead,sir.Hello. Hi. In-Yong from Goldman Sachs. Two questions from me. The first one is on thevery strong non-life growth, you mentioned some of the segment spectrum and also ifyou could give us a bit more detail around that and in particular what kind of strength thatHannover you think is allowing you to grow so much in such a challenging environment?And the second question is on kind of capital management. We're seeing continuous highlevel of unrealized gains that is still going up. But I think that's where you will considercapital money (33:10) always starts to go towards the 13% if that's kind of (33:15) thesame or does the high level of unrealized gains change that somewhat here?Well, for the non-life growth, I mean, it's always a case that there are a lot of projectswhere we are working on new business. So far, this year, the hit ratio where we actuallycame to a conclusion has been relatively high. I mean we have particularly written somenew business, which we feel is actually quite attractive in China. This is largely on aproportional basis, and it's kind of on a whole account basis of our Chinese cedants.We also, last year, had underwritten a model of quota share which was actually premiumheavy. And, originally, we expected that to vanish because these things come and go, butwe managed to renew it for another year. So that is the reason for that.Growth, I mean, I was just talking about the Japanese renewal where we managedactually to improve our market position, and, therefore, on attractive business, which wewere looking to write larger shares, so we actually were able to do so. Then there arecontinued flow of business there. The specific needs of our clients may be in conjunctionwith acquisitions who are entering new lines where support of reinsurance can be helpfuland if you have a rather broad client base, we are contacted on these opportunities quiteregularly.Of course, the hit ratio is sometimes not very large because of our margin requirement.But so far, this year, we have been reasonably successful. Of course, there are few othersin the pipeline, but again, I mean, the ink needs to be dry before you can really saysomething more definitive.On the agriculture business, we also brought significant new business both – I mean, intodeveloped North America as well as in Asia, notably India. There is a reason for thatremarkable growth. I mean, but it's also growth that you probably can gather which tosome extent is the result of a more bulky transaction that we write.As far as the capital management is concerned, of course, we have our AGM today andwe will I mean, propose to the AGM to pay a dividend of €4.25 which, of course, reducesthe capital in the second quarter. That is still on the agenda, despite the unrealized gainson – as part of the capital. Therefore, I said, I mean, that it's not yet unlikely that we mayalso pay a special dividend for 2015 should results allow, and capital markets beunchanged in their trend. So, I mean, on the subject of share buybacks with our majority ofshareholder, it's a little bit more challenging. Does that answer the question?Yes. Yes. That's very clear.

"Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Frank Kopfinger from Commerzbank.Please go ahead, sir.Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your FXeffects. Could you please explain why they only hit your Life Re segment in the otherincome and not the Non-Life segment as well?And my second question is also, could you update us on your current reinvestment yieldsand also whether you'll change your strategy going forward? And also given your strongcapitalization, whether there is some intention to put some more capital into risk or to rerisk your investments?I think, Roland, this one's for you.Yes. With regards to the FX, you know that our policy would be to always be matched andavoid positive, as well as negative effects, although positive effects are still morewelcome than negatives. Still, the overall approach would be a matched approach.That is not always possible because and I think I've explained that before, you have todecide which balance sheet you match, either the economic or the IFRS for the group, forthe single company, or the German GAAP so you have to compromise here.And in that regard, it is very often – you could see unmanageable to be matched to 100%.Here, the likelihood that we are a little bit long in the U.S. dollar was a little bit higher in thelife subsidiaries and the segments. So this is more or less by chance that these effectshave occurred on the Life side.And if I may add, of course, in the first quarter the softening of the euro was actually quitedramatic I would say, due to the quantitative easing of CZB (39:48).So the leverage of any even not very high mismatch which might be unavoidable hasbeen rather high within that one quarter.So with regards to the reinvestment yields, I think I present them twice a year. The math, itshould be around 1.6% I would assume. I haven't seen an update this year – this week. Wehave not really dramatically changed. We're still looking for more investments on the realestate side. We are looking at opportunities here or there.You know that 60% of our assets are outside the euro, which helps at least to a certainextent. Other than that, we have not changed our investment strategy. And we still expectif the yields stay where they are, that we lose around 15 basis points per year as ROI forthe portfolio.

"Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. William Hawkins from Keefe, Bruyette &Woods. Please go ahead, sir.Hello. Thank you very much. Could you just give a bit more detail about the life margins,the remarkable figures you mentioned? Because I'm just trying to understand, whenwe've got a material beat in longevity and mortality and morbidity as well versus yourbudget, is that all kind of FX or are there other common things that are worthcommenting on or is this normal quarterly volatility?Again, I'm just a bit confused about whether to say that this is a great beat and it'ssustainable and I should annualize it or if you just had a lucky quarter and in futurequarters, I should be back to your targets, so the strength outside of the one-off thatyou've clearly flagged.And then secondly, how do you want me to interpret the increase in the non-lifecombined ratio year-on-year? To what extent is that business mix and to what extent isthat occurring because of pricing? I thought what you said about the reserving and therest of it. I'm just trying to get a feel what I should conclude by that visible increase yearon-year. Thanks.Well, if I come to the life margins, I mean, I would say that you will continue to see higherlife margins on our financial solution business because it's an area which is actually quitehigh margins because really it's a lot of financing of statutory reserves. I mean, if you callit, out of the money stop losses where you would, of course, expect low premium for themost part or premium equal to the profits. And that business, there is a little bit of a firstmover advantage particularly in the U.S we have seen grown quite nicely.Also in the segment of financial solutions, we have the large morbidity treaty which had alot of premium, but very slim margin, if any, and as we discontinue that, you will seepremiums come down. But, of course, the margins increase.On the longevity business, that is not really currency because – I mean, from the currency– the claims and the premiums really are quite well aligned when they are booked. I wouldsay on the margins, on the longevity business will – a little bit high in this quarter, which hasto do with the enhanced annuity, but they will probably for the entire year will be more likea 2% to 3%.On the morbidity business, I mean, margins sustainable will be higher than in previousyears mainly due to the rate increases on the Australian group business that a lot of thatpremium comes from and that on the DII business in Australia, which was the other sourceof losses in 2013 we strengthened the reserves quite remarkable, and that seems tohold.Therefore, I mean, we are relatively positive on the development of the profitability of ourLife & Health business even though, I mean, you cannot multiply the break fee by fourbecause it is quite unlikely that we will have similar break fees in the coming quarters.As well as – as far as the non-life combined ratio is referred to, well, I mean, I don't thinkthat's a major mix in the business. I mean, of course, it's determined by the loss ratio pickfor the more recent underwriting years the fact that we keep the unused large lossbudget in reserve, and the fact that is what kind of development from previous years youhave. As there has been no release of loss reserves from previous years you can see arather pure figure here. Rather pure figure taking into account the – actually the largelosses at the expected level.With that, I would say we are relatively satisfied if it comes in below 96%. I mean in theory,the reserve releases, that number can improve, if necessary, but then we had a very goodresult in the first quarter. I mean, one thing which is of course a question we ask ourselvesall the time, when will we reduce rates, and we've seen reduced rates at least twice,sometimes three times in a row. Make itself out in the underlying loss ratio. That actuallyhas not been the case as yet in the first quarter as far as we can see.Thank you.",Operator,0.05263157894736842,2021-11-04,past,"['question', 'william', 'hawkins', 'keefe', 'bruyette', 'woods', 'ahead', 'sirhello', 'life', 'marginsthe', 'remarkable', 'figures', 'mentioned', 'understand', 'whenweve', 'material', 'beat', 'longevity', 'mortality', 'morbidity', 'versus', 'yourbudget', 'kind', 'fx', 'common', 'things', 'worthcommenting', 'normal', 'quarterly', 'volatilityagain', 'confused', 'great', 'beat', 'itssustainable', 'annualize', 'lucky', 'quarter', 'futurequarters', 'targets', 'strength', 'oneoff', 'thatyouve', 'flaggedand', 'interpret', 'increase', 'nonlifecombined', 'ratio', 'yearonyear', 'extent', 'mix', 'extent', 'isthat', 'occurring', 'pricing', 'thought', 'reserving', 'therest', 'feel', 'conclude', 'visible', 'increase', 'yearonyear', 'thankswell', 'life', 'margins', 'continue', 'higherlife', 'margins', 'financial', 'solution', 'area', 'quitehigh', 'margins', 'lot', 'financing', 'statutory', 'reserves', 'callit', 'money', 'losses', 'expect', 'low', 'premium', 'themost', 'premium', 'equal', 'profits', 'firstmover', 'advantage', 'grown', 'nicelyalso', 'segment', 'financial', 'solutions', 'large', 'morbidity', 'treaty', 'alot', 'premium', 'slim', 'margin', 'discontinue', 'seepremiums', 'margins', 'increaseon', 'longevity', 'currency', 'currency', 'claims', 'premiums', 'aligned', 'booked', 'wouldsay', 'margins', 'longevity', 'high', 'quarter', 'hasto', 'enhanced', 'annuity', 'entire', 'likea', 'morbidity', 'margins', 'sustainable', 'higher', 'previousyears', 'rate', 'increases', 'australian', 'group', 'lot', 'thatpremium', 'dii', 'australia', 'sourceof', 'losses', 'strengthened', 'reserves', 'remarkable', 'toholdtherefore', 'positive', 'development', 'profitability', 'ourlife', 'health', 'multiply', 'break', 'fee', 'fourbecause', 'break', 'fees', 'coming', 'quartersas', 'nonlife', 'combined', 'ratio', 'referred', 'thinkthats', 'major', 'mix', 'determined', 'loss', 'ratio', 'pickfor', 'underwriting', 'years', 'fact', 'unused', 'large', 'lossbudget', 'reserve', 'fact', 'kind', 'development', 'previous', 'years', 'youhave', 'release', 'loss', 'reserves', 'previous', 'years', 'arather', 'pure', 'figure', 'pure', 'figure', 'account', 'largelosses', 'expected', 'levelwith', 'satisfied', 'theorythe', 'reserve', 'releases', 'number', 'improve', 'goodresult', 'quarter', 'thing', 'question', 'ourselvesall', 'time', 'reduce', 'rates', 'reduced', 'rates', 'twicesometimes', 'times', 'row', 'underlying', 'loss', 'ratio', 'actuallyhas', 'case', 'quarter', 'seethank']","['NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'DET', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'INTJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADV', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'AUX', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB']",0.18902582,0.00092293404,0.047085483,0.002604338,0.079608634,0.14106435,0.18846561,0.046785366,0.002790597,0.014261489,0.060776714,0.010671637,0.09872374,0.036490235,0.07755858,0.0031644967
"The next question comes from Mr. Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.Yes, good morning. One question. Going back to the (47:28) on growth actually in Q1 inthe P&C Re segment. I just wanted, Ulrich, you to comment a bit more on these short-tailopportunities you're seeing in the U.S. markets. So, it seems to be pretty much underpressure for the time being due to capacity. So, I'm quite interesting to better understandwhere these short-tail opportunities are coming from.And also, if you can comment a bit more on the agro business, because it seems to bethat for a lot of guys like you, not only Hannover Re, but in general, agro business is asignificant source of business opportunities. So, could you comment about on that if thereis any potential (48:11) regulation or anything like that? And more generally speaking, couldyou update us now on how much is the agro business for the total group and what are themain geographical exposures? Thank you.Okay. When we come to the short-tail business we were mentioning. I mean, these arebusiness opportunities mostly actually on not industrial lines, but personal lines of small tomedium commercial. And, I mean, they are surrounding accumulation management ofcatastrophe exposure with our client. And they are partly also, I mean, capitalmanagement resultant. So, I mean, to that extent, there are opportunities that come andgo really. It just depends on the regions, necessities of our clients and beginning of theyear was just a few of those arose that we could achieve our margins and after significantnegotiations on the terms and conditions we finally came to a landing.I mean, another big block of our property business is, of course, our property per riskaccount. Prices are on a pressure there, but the rate reductions are, I would say, singledigit to the lower end rather than the high end. We have – I mean, particularly in the U.S.,we are the lead market on that and we have – historically had very god margins becauseagain on that for the most part it's a very well diversified book, which is not that muchbased on the heavy industrial business. And that business actually, we feel that at thecurrent rates, we still have sufficient margins, so we are looking for new business still andalso, of course, defending what we've got and we have been quite successful with that.On the agricultural business, I mean, there is increased demand, particularly in China andIndia, which we are benefiting from. Historically, we were heavily underweight in NorthAmerica and heavily overweight in Latin America. We still have very attractive portfolio inLatin America, but we have accretively large market share. But we have increased ourinvolvement in the – particularly in the U.S., following the drop that we had a couple ofyears ago. We felt that margins got a little bit better and so we got a little bit more activethere and that's where particularly in 2015, we have seen, I mean, significant growth. Butthis is really, I mean, one or two new transactions which are quite large and makesthemselves felt.I think, if you look at our overall volume on the agricultural business this year, we couldreach, I would say close to $500 million. So, it becomes an important part of our P&Cbusiness. A little bit gratifying that we had also good profitability last year because that isthe big challenge on the agricultural business. It is a challenge for that business to beprofitable. So, we have to be very diligent when we underwrite it.Does that answer the question?Thank you very much.Thank you.",Operator,0.42857142857142855,2021-11-04,past,"['question', 'thomas', 'fossard', 'hsbc', 'ahead', 'siryes', 'good', 'morning', 'question', 'growth', 'inthe', 'segment', 'wanted', 'ulrich', 'comment', 'shorttailopportunities', 'markets', 'pretty', 'underpressure', 'time', 'capacity', 'interesting', 'understandwhere', 'shorttail', 'opportunities', 'coming', 'fromand', 'comment', 'agro', 'bethat', 'lot', 'guys', 'hannover', 'general', 'agro', 'asignificant', 'source', 'opportunities', 'comment', 'thereis', 'potential', 'regulation', 'generally', 'speaking', 'couldyou', 'update', 'agro', 'total', 'group', 'themain', 'geographical', 'exposures', 'youokay', 'shorttail', 'mentioning', 'arebusiness', 'opportunities', 'industrial', 'lines', 'personal', 'lines', 'small', 'tomedium', 'commercial', 'surrounding', 'accumulation', 'management', 'ofcatastrophe', 'exposure', 'client', 'partly', 'capitalmanagement', 'resultant', 'extent', 'opportunities', 'andgo', 'depends', 'regions', 'necessities', 'clients', 'theyear', 'arose', 'achieve', 'margins', 'significantnegotiations', 'terms', 'conditions', 'finally', 'landingi', 'big', 'block', 'property', 'property', 'riskaccount', 'prices', 'pressure', 'rate', 'reductions', 'singledigit', 'lower', 'high', 'uswe', 'lead', 'market', 'historically', 'god', 'margins', 'becauseagain', 'diversified', 'book', 'muchbased', 'heavy', 'industrial', 'feel', 'thecurrent', 'rates', 'sufficient', 'margins', 'andalso', 'defending', 'successful', 'thaton', 'agricultural', 'increased', 'demand', 'china', 'andindia', 'benefiting', 'historically', 'heavily', 'underweight', 'northamerica', 'heavily', 'overweight', 'latin', 'america', 'attractive', 'portfolio', 'inlatin', 'america', 'accretively', 'large', 'market', 'share', 'increased', 'ourinvolvement', 'drop', 'couple', 'ofyears', 'ago', 'felt', 'margins', 'activethere', 'growth', 'butthis', 'transactions', 'large', 'makesthemselves', 'felti', 'volume', 'agricultural', 'couldreach', 'close', 'pcbusiness', 'gratifying', 'good', 'profitability', 'isthe', 'big', 'challenge', 'agricultural', 'challenge', 'beprofitable', 'diligent', 'underwrite', 'itdoes', 'answer', 'questionthank', 'muchthank']","['NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'ADV', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'VERB', 'PRON', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'PRON', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADV', 'ADV', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'ADJ', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'ADV', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'DET', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN']",0.0028142396,0.0057760985,0.10637913,0.22888532,0.0029403784,0.008351114,0.1386241,0.044859413,0.045586616,0.06359821,0.06579471,0.026495483,0.15216233,0.070561245,0.03350088,0.0036707758
"Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please goahead, sir.Good Morning. Two questions. The first one is on capital. You sound – I mean, earlier in theQ&A, you sound very – highly confident that you should be in a surplus capital position atthe year-end. Could you – I mean, unless we've got a massive (52:51) in between now andthen, which is Solvency III. Could you just give us a quick update on where you stand onSolvency II and whether you see any kind of other potential major impacts on your capitalposition between now and then?And the second question is just on M&A. I know you talking about this in the pastvaluations were a bit right. But is it happening at the moment given kind of a renewedfocus on maybe growing the top line where the business is attractive that this issomething that you might consider? Thanks.As far as the surplus capital goals and Solvency II, I mean we have hired our internal capitalmodel for Hannover Re subgroup with our regulator in Germany and that looks to theextent you can be sure when you talk with regulators quite positive, I would say. So, Imean, from that point of view, in 2016 as the, I mean, legal capital adequacy should bevery comfortable, I would say, well in access of 200%.So from that point of view, I mean excess capital is not a question. We still have theconstraints of the rating agencies, which – I mean we have got our capital model is a littlebit more precise for our business than theirs. That is still a slightly higher challenge.However, also as their situation looks quite comfortable. So from that point of view, eventaking into account the necessary buffer, we are relatively confident, actually veryconfident that we will have sufficient and even more than sufficient capital by year-end.M&A activities, yes, I mean, we have constantly looking for M&A activities. We also have afew targets in lines that could be very attractive for us. Unfortunately for the most part,they are not for sale at this point in time or very expensive. Therefore, on large M&Aactivities, there currently no hot topic or hot project that we are working at, I would say.But, I mean, of course, we would always be interested in – if we find targets that canimprove our overall business profile, that would most likely go into the direction of aspecialty reinsurer or a combined insurance and reinsurance operation with a very strongpractice in this lines of specialty insurance.If I may add to that comment, you mentioned that there might be a higher focus on topline growth again. I don't see that. Even if we have been growing in the first quarter morethan expected, we have not comprised our margin requirements or whatever, and we arestill prepared to not grow in case the business is not profitable. So there is no readjustedfocus on top line.That's very clear.

"Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from AutonomousResearch. Please go ahead.Hi there. I've actually – just two sort of clarifications from William's questions earlier. I'm notsure when you talked about the margin in mortality and morbidity business, which is 8.1%in Q1 versus the target of 6% you were suggesting that part of that is because of therepricing that occurred in Australia. Are you saying then that the 6% target is sort of out ofdate now? And given the repricing, should we be accustomed to a higher target?

So, maybe just to clarify, isthere an – was it really just quite a benign experience in Q1 or is there a structuralreexamination of that margin we need to think about?And the second question, again clarifying, you said you were looking all the time to see ifthere would be a margin erosion coming through in non-life because of the (57:57) ofweaker pricing. You said that you haven't seen it yet. So the underlying margindeterioration in non-life when we allow for the fact that you've got to fully (58:08) anormal budget (58:10) losses this year and last year is what then? It's just mix effects? Andwhen do you think you will start to see some underlying margin and erosion through?Well, I mean, firstly, the margin from the morbidity business. Of course, for the morbiditybusiness, they have historically been for the most part below 6% while mortality wasabout 6%. I mean, on the Australian group business, the current margins are we above6%. However, I mean, there is already reoccurring competition for that business arriving inthat market because, I mean, as the overall reinsurance market is soft and people seesigns of improvement in that business, of course, there is immediately a renewed interestin that class.So for us, it's obviously a little bit important that we are, I mean, not waiting until theimprovement is actually seen, but are already involved in the improvement happening intothe Australian group business. That looks well for us, of course, only if there's highermargins that we think we have now actually materialize itself in the longer time.So I wouldn't say that – and I think that the 6% is still a good guidance for mortality andmorbidity combined and it's still a hurdle which is not that easy to constantly develop thatfar. Despite the fact, again, also that the new business that we write, the margins that wecalculate are above that figure. But of course, I mean, actually to expect that also we haveto take them into account. But as I said, I mean, this, getting the problem areascontinuously better under control, we expect that the margins on our Life & Healthbusiness will increase.On the non-life...And the 6% is consistent with the ROE target generally, is it right?Absolutely. Absolutely.Yes. Okay.I mean, if you go to the non-life business, I'm absolutely certain that the reduced rateeventually will make it felt in the underlying loss ratios. I mean, it's a little bit maybeprolonged because of the continued very, very low inflation rate, but that is no way thatyou can reduce the rates three years in a row and still hope that will not be shown, it willnot be seen in your combined ratios and loss ratios in, fact.That's why we are so protective of our buffers on the loss reserves, because we expectthat we will actually need I mean part of that in the coming years. And, therefore, everyyear like 2014 or the first quarter of 2015, we can continue to reserve very conservative inthe current market environment on the P&C side it's bonus for us.Okay. So, what you are saying is obviously the deterioration we saw on an underlying basisyear-on-year is kind of partly prior year noise, partly mix noise, really, not margin yet?No, this is not margin. It's really based on nurturing our reserve buffer.Okay. Okay. Great.

"The next question comes from Anasuya Iyer from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Oh hi. My question is just coming back to capital. At the Investor Day last year, you gave us€1 billion number for your excess capital allowing for rating agency. Do you have an updateon that given how the capital has moved since then?And also how should I think about the usage of that capital especially given the growthopportunities that you're saying are now in Australia and large volume treaties? Thanks.Well, we haven't got an update on the excess capital because we haven't yet calculated iton the Q1 figures which, of course, I mean the capital clearly has increased, but with theincreased volume, also the capital requirement would have increased. So, we have to seethere that we come out there. I mean, use of that capital is still a challenge, I would say.Yes, we have seen a good opportunity at the beginning of the year, but still the marketoverall is relatively soft. So, I mean, that will be a little bit back and forth.So, I mean we are still not in a position where we could use the capital without significantlychanging the volatility of the earnings. We, of course, could use the capital by – I mean,significantly increasing our natural catastrophe risk appetite because we seem to be in theposition to write more natural catastrophe business if we want, or we could increase thisrisk on our investment portfolio, for example, by, I mean, investing in equities.However, we still see higher value to keep the volatility of our earnings to a lower level inthe current phase because we are still relatively satisfied with the absolute level of ourearnings, and therefore, from that volatility perspective, we could use the capital whileincreasing the volatility. We still more like to keep our powder dry to times and theopportunities are better.And maybe from my side to the capital models of the rating agencies, I think I wouldendorse what Uli indicated here. We have seen an increase in the capital position. So theadjusted capital is higher. But also we have seen the drivers, the currency exchange rateplus also the increase in the premiums which do get additional capital charge. So I wouldassume and the first calculations would confirm that the position has not changeddrastically when it comes to the excess position.Okay.
