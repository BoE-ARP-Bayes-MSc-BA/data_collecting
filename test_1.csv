"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re InternationalConference Call on the Q3 2021 Financial Results. For your information, this conference isbeing recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.JeanJacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call presenting the resultsof Hannover Re for the first nine months of this year. As usual, I'll start with an overviewbefore our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the financials in more detail. And then, Iwill comment on the outlook for this year and for 2022. For the Q&A, as always, I'madditionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.In the first nine months of this year, Hannover Re has again proved its resilience in achallenging market environment in life and health reinsurance. The results continued to beimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And in P&C reinsurance, we had to deal with theelevated large losses from natural catastrophes, most prominently the European floodsand Hurricane Ida in the third quarter.The fact that we still achieved a double-digit return on equity, year-to-date highlights thestrong underlying profitability of the group and our successful volatility management.Additionally, the group net income of EUR856 million is in line with our full year targetrange of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25 billion, and hence, we have kept our profit guidanceunchanged.Gross premium increased by 14.4% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven byour P&C business group, where we recorded continued strong top line growth on theback of improving market conditions and increased demand from our clients, althoughgrowth in life and health reinsurance was also ahead of our expectations.In P&C reinsurance, the large loss impact of more than EUR1 billion was clearly above ourbudget for the first nine months. Adjusted for this quarterly budget overrun, the technicalprofitability was, however, in line with our expectations.Furthermore, this is supported by our unchanged net estimate of COVID-19 relatedlosses, which has now been stable since the end of 2020 at EUR950 million. Asmentioned, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a significant impact in life andhealth reinsurance. Within our portfolio, the main markets affected by COVID-relatedexcess mortality of the U.S., but also South Africa, where Hannover Re has a very strongmarket position.All-in-all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR404 million and most notablythe third quarter losses of around EUR140 million, came ahead of our initial expectation.As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio led to apositive one-off effect of EUR129 million. Additionally, we recorded a positive effect ofEUR99 million from reserve releases in the longevity in Q3, partly mitigating the COVID-19impact.At 2.9%, the return on investment is significantly ahead of our expectations, mainly drivenby favorable ordinary income. Our capitalization according to Solvency II continued to beexcellent confirmed by our strong solvency ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter,well above our 200% threshold. The main reason for the decrease in the third quarter isthe increase in required capital due to the attractive business growth, including the growthwe expect to see in 2022. This leads to an increase in SCR, whereas the positive impacton own funds is less immediate due to our conservative assumptions for new business.Furthermore, large losses in P&C and COVID losses in life and health, had a negativeimpact on the solvency ratio year-to-date.The operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2021 reached a record high of EUR4.2billion, mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results onthe investment side. The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from therestructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio of EUR640 million.Overall, the positive cash flow fueled the strong growth in assets under ownmanagement to an all-time high of about EUR55 billion. This growth was additionallysupported by ForEx effects and the issuance of EUR750 million in hybrid capital, alreadyknown in March. This bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our totalhybrid capital to EUR3 billion. Despite this issuance, we still have material flexibility inregard to our total hybrid capacity. On the right-hand side, you can see that our strongprofitability is the main reason for the increase in shareholders' equity. And additionally,the change in OCI was slightly positive, because negative valuation effect were offset bypositive currency translation.On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail.Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques and good morning, everyone. I would dive straight into thereporting for our business groups and start with P&C. We now look back at all importantrenewal dates in 2021. And you can see gross and net premium in P&C reinsurance grewby a remarkable 18% adjusted for currency effect.The growth is highly diversified with particularly strong momentum in North America, inGermany, and in Southeast Asia. On top of this, we successfully expanded our structuredreinsurance book, and we also were able to increase the volume of our facultativereinsurance book. As in previous years, we would expect the growth in gross premium toslow down somewhat; however, the net premium growth should remain more stable.As you all know, the impact from large losses was significant in the third quarter of 2021.For Hannover Re, this resulted in net large losses of EUR1.07 billion for the first ninemonths, clearly above our budget of EUR849 million for the first nine months. The net lossestimate for COVID-19 related losses, however, remained unchanged at EUR950 million.All together, the combined ratio of 97.9% for the first nine months is very solid, in light ofthe observed loss activity and the underlying figures are in line with our targets.Net investment income in P&C increased based on strong ordinary income, higherrealized gains, and lower impairments. Other income and expenses include negativecurrency effects of EUR105 million. In the previous year, we had almost the same amountas a positive contribution, and I alluded to that already in the second quarter, that it ismainly an accounting mismatch as we have a similar movement in our equity. All together,the EBIT increased strongly to EUR161 million, thanks to the improved investment resultsand the favorable underwriting result, which had been heavily impacted by COVID lossesin the previous year. Finally, the tax ratio is at normal level.On the next slide, as mentioned, total net large losses accounted for EUR1.07 billion,that's EUR221 million above budget. This means that we have already almost reached thelevel of EUR1.1 billion budgeted for the full year after the first nine months. Of course, theyear-to-date budget overall is absorbed in the Q3 result, and hence the EUR251 millionbudgeted for Q3 -- for Q4, are still available.On the next slide, looking at our large losses, the two largest events were unsurprisinglythe European floods with a net loss of EUR214 million and Hurricane Ida with EUR306million net for our account. On top of this, we have seen further increases in the lossestimates for storm Volker and the Texas freeze on the NatCat side. However, man-madelosses also increased by slightly more than EUR100 million in Q3, almost entirely due tothe riots in South Africa, which are included in the property losses with an amount ofEUR94 million. Altogether, the impact from both NatCat and man-made losses wassignificant in Q3, pushing the actual loss experience above the budget for the first ninemonths.The next slide, as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reportingline. The picture I'd say very much reflects the large loss situation. I've just explained,combined ratios for EMEA, affected by the European floods and by the riots in SouthAfrica, while the Americas include significant losses from Hurricane Ida and the Texasfreeze.The worldwide markets show a rather mixed picture. Facultative and agricultural businessare mainly impacted by large losses in the technical profitability and credit and surety, aswell as in aviation and marine, is really excellent driven by favorable underlying lossdevelopment and positive reserve runoff.Let's move on to life and health, then on the next slide. The pleasing business growth isreflected in both the premium and in value of new business. And really, I'd say, comesfrom all our four important categories. Growth is actually quite diversified by region aswell. As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the technical result was still affected by losses inconnection with COVID-19. Around 85% of the losses stemmed from two markets, EUR197million from the U.S. and EUR149 million from South Africa. The losses in South Africa wereparticularly significant in the third quarter, whereas the losses from the U.S. were lowerthan in previous quarters.On the positive side, we recorded a positive effect of EUR99 million from reservereleases for our longevity portfolio. In part to really avoid misunderstandings, I think thisneeds some additional explanation. You might be wondering how we can have furtherreserve releases when we have locked in assumptions according to address foraccounting and usually, we do not even have to set up reserves for this kind of treaties.The reason is that we have so-called provisions for adverse developments and as Claudealready explained at our Investors Day, not long ago in recent months, we have receivedupdated mortality data from our clients, showing that the mortality within our enforceportfolio has been higher than expected.Hence, we could release those provisions for adverse developments those had, becausemore people in our portfolio have actually died than initially assumed, not because weassume any different mortality trends for the future.In other words, the impact does not reflect any general change in assumptions for ourlongevity business, which would be uncertain, but only higher mortality in the enforcebook, which of course is completely certain.Furthermore, it is also important to note that the updated mortality data is largely for preCOVID period and not affected by the pandemic.Finally, as explained in our Q1 conference call, the restructuring of parts of the INGportfolio in U.S. mortality led to a positive one-off effect affecting various lines items in theP&L. In total, the positive impact was EUR129 million. The ordinary investment income wasin line with expectations. The fair value of financial instruments decreased materially. Thenegative impact was driven by the valuation of derivative embedded in a life reinsurancecontract in the UK. And additionally, the previous year had benefited from positivevaluation gains from an equity participation.Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution fromour Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which is recognized according to thedeposit accounting method. Currency effect here in line and has had a rather minorimpact. Altogether, the EBIT of EUR220 million is satisfactory, reflecting theaforementioned positive and negative extraordinary effects.On the next slide, as usual, a quick look at the non-IFRS metric for business growth in lifeand health, the value of new business according to Solvency II. In Q3, we again tookadvantage of the attractive opportunities for financial solutions in the U.S., but also inChina and we further expanded our longevity book in the UK. The total value of newbusiness for the first nine months supports our full year minimum target of EUR250million. Furthermore, the pipeline currently looks very promising, and I would say we arewell on track in terms of new business production.On the next slide, the development of our investments. I think it's fair to say that thedevelopment in the first quarter and in the first nine months of the year was verysatisfactory. The ordinary investment income is particularly strong. The main drivers for thisdevelopment are the excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Then theoverall asset growth fueled by our very positive cash flow as well as the impact fromincreased actual inflation numbers and the associated positive impact on the amortizationof our inflation linked bond.Realized gains have also increased compared to last year and are mainly the result ofroutine portfolio management as well as some strategic -- let's say, as we mentioned thesale of listed equities in the first quarter, which have contributed EUR50 million to therealized gains. Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous year,where we had recorded some impairments in the more volatile market environment. So,this year's number is more or less at expected low levels to a large extent comprisingregular depreciation on our real estate portfolio.As explained in my comments on life and health, derivative valuation was negative. So, theoverall return on investment was 2.9% and we expect to achieve a higher return than ourinitial full year expectation of roughly 2.4%.Unrealized gains, as you can see here, decreased by around EUR500 million, mainly dueto the increase in interest rates that are compared to year-end 2020.On the next slide, well known, I think the asset allocation developed in line with ourstrategy. The most notable change is the reallocation from government bonds intocorporate bonds. The focus here is on large and small corporates in developed markets.The contributions to ordinary investments income is diversified as usual. The highlight asmentioned is probably the recovery in the contribution from private equity to the stronglevels we had seen before the market volatility, caused by the pandemic.To conclude my remarks, the first nine months and in particularly, the third quarter provedto be a challenging period for the reinsurance industry, and therefore, the overall resultand the fact that we have confirmed our full year profit guidance for 2021 highlightsHannover Re's strong ability to manage and absorb volatility.On that note, I'd hand back to you Jean-Jacques for the comments on the outlook.Thank you very much, Clemens. On the next slide, the target metrics confirms Clemens'summary. Most notably, our main profitability target for the group, the return on equity iswell above our minimum target, even though the underwriting results in both P&C and lifeand health are impacted by extraordinary losses. This also means that the EBIT growthtargets in P&C and life and health are somewhat distorted by COVID claims. Thesetargets being more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the strategiccycle.More importantly, growth is significantly ahead of the strategic target, providing a strongbasis for a successful business development in 2022.So, before we move on to the outlook for next year, let's have a brief look at ourguidance for the year 2021. As mentioned, the profit guidance remains unchanged.Thinking about the individual components contributing to this number, the premiumgrowth is stronger than initially expected, and together with a higher return oninvestment, this should be sufficient to compensate for higher-than-expected large lossesin P&C and higher-than-expected COVID losses in life and health, which were also partlyoffset by positive one-off effect as we've seen.For the fourth quarter, further impacts from COVID claims is likely in life and health. Eventhough the development of the pandemic remains uncertain, the accelerating vaccinationprogress in South Africa in particular provides the basis for decreasing excess mortality inthis country. The targeted ordinary dividend according to our new definition ascommunicated at our Investors Day is at least the EUR4.5 paid out this year. As before, wewill consider paying a special dividend on top of this if the capitalization exceeds ourcapital requirements for future growth and profit targets are achieved. And as of today,I'd say that both sides of trend are being met.As usual, at this time of the year, we publish our guidance for the expectations for nextyear, as mentioned, growth opportunities are attractive, and we therefore, expect grossreturn premium to increase by at least 5%. As in previous years, the growth is likely to bemore pronounced in P&C reinsurance. The return on investment should be at least 2.3%,the 10 basis points being -- decrease being -- versus our initial guidance for this year,reflecting the low interest rate environment with reinvestment deals below our portfolioyield.The group net income is expected to be within the range of EUR1.4 billion to EUR1.5billion, an underlying improvement of around EUR250 million compared to our guidancefor this year. The main driver for the improvement is the profitable growth in this andprevious years, in particular in P&C reinsurance. And this growth is not only leading to animproved underwriting result, it has additionally led to a very positive cash flow, which inturn forms the basis for the favorable growth in assets under own management. And theincreased asset base is expected to more than compensate for the slight reduction inrelative returns.In life and health, growth is similarly helpful, but the profitability is also expected toimprove. The uncertainty in life and health is somewhat higher due to the futuredevelopment of the COVID-19 pandemic. And with this in mind, we have added adisclaimer to the effect that no material COVID lost is -- are included in the guidance.In addition, we have not included any potential relief from our mortality rate for cover,which is likely to payout in 2022. So, there is some allowance for COVID claims embeddedin our guidance, but no significant numbers.Apart from this, the guidance is under the usual provisor the large losses stayed within thebudget in P&C. And the budget has increased to EUR1.3 billion. And of course, also thatthere are no major distortions in the capital market. The increased large loss budget ismainly a reflection of business growth. Last but not least, the dividend policy is the sameas -- for this year. The ordinary dividend announced in March 2022 will be our floor for theordinary dividend and we have a potential special dividend on top. Altogether, ourguidance reflects the positive development and successful cycle management of thegroup and we're quite positive about the outlook for next year.This concludes my remarks. And as always, we would be happy to answer your questions.Questions And Answers",Operator,0.46,2021-11-04,past,"['good', 'morning', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'todays', 'hannover',

"(Question And Answer)Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. (OperatorInstructions) And the first question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Your line is nowopen. Please go ahead.Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased catbudget for 2022, the EUR1.3 billion. Because you split that between man-made andNatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21. I guess I'm justcurious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growthor is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talkabout it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volumeversus anything else going on?My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color. I'mjust trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, beforewe'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to updateagain unreleased further PADs. If there's something, it could be that much of a gapbetween when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flowfrom cedents. Thanks.Thank you. So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address thelongevity release.Yes. With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versusNatCat. So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021.So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1.3 billion is manmade and EUR1.050 billion is the natural catastrophe. The growth is not a proxy for ourpremium growth ambitions for next year. As always, it is the mix between the growth wehave seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our majorloss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipatedgrowth we expect for next year.The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related. There's only a smallerportion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we arevalidating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three tofour years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of thatis flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022.Okay. Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side. The way how it works aswe -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pensioninsurer. And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at theforefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting.So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do thatand they have to change their systems to administer that. And that takes usually at least ayear, sometimes two, sometimes even more.We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible)and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we getat least annual update. Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes wehave to ask for it. So, a delay of two years is probably the norm.And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixedlag, which is fixed from the outset. We know exactly these numbers. They don't even haveto send it to us. And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have topay. And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag. We know thatthe treaty is basically going according to plan. And then, we just book these numbers.What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same assomebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000. So, in the monthlyaccounts, you don't see a difference. But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot ofthese claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher thanif somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,much shorter.And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especiallywriting new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the(inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start getting this up todate and again this year. And you can expect this for the future. If we don't update the(inaudible) and release the PADs as Clemens mentioned earlier, you should expect ourprofits are improving from year-to-year in small -- very small set. And then only as soon aswe take the (inaudible) and clean up for the people who have died more than expected.And obviously, we can release all the provisions for adverse deviations for these deadpeople because we definitely don't need it. Then you will see a big profit like you see thisyear. This should happen regularly every two or three years.Yes. Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible)Sure.-- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest. So,there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount thatwe've seen this year.But just to make one point clear, this is not a new assumption setting for mortality in thefuture. This is cleaning up the portfolio for people who have died. And therefore, clearly,we don't need to pass any long term.Great. Thanks very much. Thank you.Thank you.",Operator,0.38095238095238093,2021-11-04,past,"['question', 'answerladies', 'gentlemen', 'questionandanswer', 'session', 'operatorinstructions', 'question', 'andrew', 'ritchie',

"The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please goahead.Hey, good morning. Thank you very much. So, a few questions please if I can. First is that,I'm noticing, I mean, you're talking about Solvency FTR growth, but I can't seem torecollect that, it was there, for example, similar period last year, might have been, but wedidn't really mention it. The growth was similar. So, I just wanted to know, is there anythingmore remarkable in that number? And this is more a quick check really.Second question is on the combined ratios in credit. I think I can back calculate 3Q is about73%. Now, remember that we keep talking about how the economic recovery andinsolvency in state schemes going away. Is there any reserve movement here or anythingmore notable please?Just one more question on retro please. The bond recovery is very, very high. I mean 240net growth, 643, I think is one of the very strong recoveries for a single loss. Could youcomment on that? With also some comments please on Texas freeze?And just lastly, please, the cash flow of EUR1.5 billion is very, very high, very high as far asme. You mentioned investment income, the roads and the business, but is there anythingmore remarkable, for instance, I mean, there would also be payouts to be made on theseEUR1 billion plus of losses. Would that be affecting cash flows in the future as well? So, Ijust wanted to understand the cash flow well? Thank you very much.Thank you, Vinit. So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status andcredit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this.Yes, Vinit. Good morning. Let's start with the Solvency I. So, it's really as Jean-Jacquesmentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all. So, if wewould be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on thebasis of Q2 of 250 roughly. So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily. It's the usualexercise that we do in Q3.First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growththat we've seen in this year. But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle forthe next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected newbusiness both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reasonwhy the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio. Again, it's theusual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as wespeak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually.And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, inQ4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4. What is probably also worthmentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to abit more alternative investments, et cetera. I think that has also contributed to an SCRincrease. But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at ournew business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then inthe next quarter.",Operator,0.35714285714285715,2021-11-04,past,"['question', 'vinit', 'malhotra', 'mediobanca', 'open', 'goaheadhey', 'good', 'morning', 'questions', 'thatim', 'noticing', 'talking', 'solvency', 'ftr', 'growth', 'torecollect', 'period', 'year', 'wedidnt', 'mention', 'growth', 'wanted', 'anythingmore', 'remarkable', 'number', 'quick', 'check', 'reallysecond', 'question', 'combined', 'ratios', 'credit', 'calculate', 'remember', 'talking', 'economic', 'recovery', 'andinsolvency', 'state', 'schemes', 'reserve', 'movement', 'anythingmore', 'notable', 'pleasejust', 'question', 'retro', 'bond', 'recovery', 'high', 'growth', 'strong', 'recoveries', 'single', 'loss', 'youcomment', 'comments', 'texas', 'freezeand', 'lastly', 'cash', 'flow', 'high', 'high', 'asme', 'investment', 'income', 'roads', 'business', 'anythingmore', 'remarkable', 'instance', 'payouts', 'losses', 'cash', 'flows', 'future', 'ijust', 'wanted', 'understand', 'cash', 'flow', 'muchthank', 'vinit', 'technical', 'difficulty', 'cash', 'flow', 'clemens', 'status', 'andcredit', 'technical', 'difficulty', 'large', 'losses', 'sven', 'comment', 'thisyes', 'vinit', 'good', 'morning', 'start', 'solvency', 'jeanjacquesmentioned', 'scr', 'increase', 'funds', 'moved', 'wewould', 'stable', 'solvency', 'ratio', 'thebasis', 'roughly', 'scr', 'increased', 'heavily', 'usualexercise', 'reflection', 'jeanjacques', 'current', 'business', 'growththat', 'year', 'regularly', 'planning', 'cycle', 'forthe', 'year', 'include', 'scr', 'model', 'internal', 'model', 'expected', 'newbusiness', 'health', 'scr', 'calculation', 'reasonwhy', 'main', 'driver', 'decrease', 'solvency', 'ratio', 'theusual', 'exercise', 'couple', 'years', 'wespeak', 'vinit', 'case', 'dip', 'actuallyand', 'expect', 'funds', 'reserving', 'position', 'cetera', 'expect', 'number', 'increase', 'worthmentioning', 'slight', 'reallocation', 'assets', 'portfolio', 'investment', 'abit', 'alternative', 'investments', 'cetera', 'contributed', 'scrincrease', 'reserving', 'ournew', 'business', 'funds', 'perspective', 'reflecting', 'inthe', 'quarter']","['NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'PROPN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PRON', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'PROPN', 'ADV', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'AUX', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'PRON', 'NOUN', 'ADV', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'DET', 'NOUN']",0.017852206,0.05448763,0.041082133,0.056022745,0.1107227,0.0026189338,0.2366351,0.16992979,0.060471706,0.2252868,0.024890212
"On the cash flow, nothing really significant. I mean, Jean-Jacques mentioned, for example,the Q1 effects from Voya and, of course, the bond issuance, et cetera, but in Q3, it's reallythe business in flow. And I think what is probably worth mentioning here, when it is the factthat we have seen very low payout ratios when it comes to our plane. I think that'sprobably the main driver, that the cash outflows for large losses has been lower than Iwould have expected. I hope that answers the questions, Vinit.Yeah. Thank you.The credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positiverunoff from old underwriting years. We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level ofinsolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runofffor the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that wenow had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus. So, the short-termlevel of insolvencies were below our original assumptions.And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long. So, three to five years, we couldnow release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years.When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and thenet is relatively high. This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both ourtransactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, whichexplains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, thebulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually thedifference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting. So, EUR180 million out ofthat gap is coming from our fronting activities. So, on Ida, we had -- we have booked Krecoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position. And on thewinter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoffin the third quarter, which is due to the very late reporting from ceding companies on thatfreeze loss. So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting andcapacity for construction in the U.S., the reporting is slower compared to the usualreporting periods. We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we shouldhave seen the full impact of winter storm Uri with this third quarter figures.Okay.

"The next question is from William Hardcastle, UBS. Your line is now open. Please goahead.Hi, morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on that. So, essentially on the frontingbusiness, is what you're saying the difference between the gross and net, obviously onthe floods is bigger versus Ida. Is that because of the greater fronting on Europeanbusiness? Is that what you're saying?No. Not at all. That's not what I was saying or trying to say at least. When it comes to theGerman business, we hardly do any fronting. So, the difference on burnt between grossand net, is really our own retro sessions. So, the gross number you are seeing is alsoalmost exclusively our own writing. that situation is different on an Ida. The U.S. portfolio isthe peak portfolio in our fronting activities. So, therefore out of the EUR527 million ofgross, approximately EUR180 million is fronted business, where -- while on burnt, it isalmost zero.Sure. It's quite the opposite of what I was saying. So, effectively your retro is kicking farstronger in your own account from the floods than has on Ida. Is there anything why that'shappened? Is there a specific reason?Well, it's a question of market share. Given that our subsidiary for the German business,the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business. Ourmarket share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but alsothe NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the UnitedStates, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight.Okay. Moving to (inaudible) I'll go to my actual questions now. What benefit did thereinstatement premium have in Q3 for P&C? And is this already factored in when youprovide the 2022 outlook, to say greater than 5%? And perhaps any quantification of whatthat impact is?And the second one is, you've touched on there on the 2022 guidance, no materialCOVID-19 impact in life and health. Just for clarity, it sounds like you're not assuming zero,but certainly less than something like EUR100 million. Is that a very fair assumption?Yes. On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking thosereinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effectinto 2022 from reinstatement premiums. I don't have any precise numbers for you on howhigh exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were.

"On COVID, life and health, William, I think your assumption is right. We have built in someexpectation in our 2022 guidance for COVID related claims. It's not going to be a tripledigit number. It's somewhere a double-digit number I think that we've baked in. On top ofthat though, we still have the potential coverage from our retro pandemic cover in life andhealth, that will be most likely paid out in 2022. So, that will give us an additional buffer forthe year. But as Jean-Jacques mentioned, it shouldn't -- should not significantly deviatefrom those numbers.And just on that pandemic retro cover, it sounds like you feel very confident that will payout now, is that because Q3 losses for excess mortality came in ahead of yourexpectation, that it's effectively giving greater certainty that it will kick in. Is that how weshould read that?Yes. That's absolutely correct. Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to ourown calculation. From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will dothe calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021.

"The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please goahead.Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. The first one would be related to the walk fromthe '22 guidance versus 2021. If you could add maybe a bit of color on the underlyingassumptions you have taken? The second quick question will be, regarding COVIDscenario for 2022, I guess that you built something in into your 239% Solvency II ratioalready, given it's forward-looking in terms of calculation. So, would you mind sayingmaybe a range of what you're already expecting for 2022?And so, the last question would be, just to come back on the 2.3% return on investmentguidance for 2022, and especially knowing that you reported 2.9% or 2.8% ordinaryinvestment income in 2021. I mean, you've got the support from private equity frominflation linkers, but I'm wondering either 2.3% should be -- if nothing exceptionally is inthe reported nine months 2021, I'm wondering, is the 2.3% should be compared to the2.4% 2020 guidance or to the 2.8% 2021, and 2.3% seems to be super, super cautious,given what you achieved this year. Thank you.Yes. Thomas, let's probably start with the guidance for 2022. So, overall, I think withoutgoing too much into the details, the core question is, where does the increase in netincome mainly stem from. It's clearly a mix of effect. In the bottom line, first of all, ofcourse, the significant business growth that we've seen both in P&C -- in life and healthand in P&C, the quality of the book should have increased over the last couple of years.So, we will certainly increase -- we'll see an increase of profitability and in P&C here andthere. And of course, the overall amount of the growth will be reflected in higher EBITnumbers in P&C. On the life and health book, as mentioned earlier, the expectation is thatwe will see significant less COVID-19 claims in the life and health segment. So, theunderlying profitability of the business should come through in 2022. That will be anotherlarge contributor.On the investment side, I think, yes, when you look at the numbers, they do seem verycautious for 2022. We are optimistic that we will at least reach that number, the 2.3%, butI'm just conscious of the fact, of course, that we've seen sort of a rebound in thecontribution from alternative investment, that amount has been significant. I think roughlyEUR100 million of our ordinary income is only related to an increase compared to last yearof the contribution of alternative investments, mainly private equity. So, I wouldn't reallyfactor that in going forward for every year. I think that did come a bit as a surprise for me,to be honest, also the valuations on the private equity side, which have increasedsignificantly. So, I wouldn't really want to expect that amount for 2022.Inflation-linked bonds, the same picture there. We have seen a huge contribution,probably EUR100 million more this year as well, compared to last year, given the currentinflation environment and the way the amortization of our inflation-linked bonds work. So,there are two -- at least two effects in the ordinary already, that we will see to someextent in next year, but we have been a bit more cautious on that end.On Solvency II, if I got the question right, Thomas, but please add. So, how much from theSCR increase would we attribute to our growth in 2022? I don't have the exact number.But I think overall, it's certainly on the Solvency II ratio, probably a double digit -- lowdouble-digit number, or a high single-digit, a low double-digit number that is attributableto that effect. But again --Yes. I think, Clemens, I was more thinking about the prospective COVID-19 mortalitylosses that you are expecting to incur in 2022, which may already be reflected into yourSolvency II ratio at Q3.Yes. No, that is not -- I don't think that is included in the SCR and in the own funds yet. Wewill do an update of that planning and the effect I think in the fourth quarter, but it's notreflected.

"The next question is from Iain Pearce, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please goahead.Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the growth numbers. When welook at the impact on the Solvency II ratio and the increase in the cat budget, theimplication is probably that growth is going to be significantly ahead of 5% especially inP&C rates. So firstly, do you think that's a fair assumption?And then secondly, is there anything in terms of life and health growth that you're thinkingis going to be lower, that's leading you to maintain that 5% growth target? The secondone was just a quick clarification, the life retro kicks in, is it a 100% excess of normalmortality that the trigger for that parametric cover?And then, the third one was just on longevity releases and the potential for these goingforward. Sort of -- you sort of cautioned us against factoring in too much here, but if youthink -- if I thinking in sort of your key longevity markets, mortality has been trendingfavorably consistently over the last couple of years before we even factor in any impactsfrom COVID. Why should we not be thinking that these are going to be some -- there'sgoing to be continued favorable longevity development?Thank you. So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth inP&C, Sven you can add there again.Okay. Let's start with the growth on the life and health side. We are quite optimistic thatwe are growing, but most of that will be -- and this is where our focus is on the bottomline, it's not on the top line. Top line happened every now and then, and you have tounderstand there are basically three ways to grow the top line here.On the -- either we really write new large blocks of business, that will increase top line ormost of our treaties on the mortality side -- morbidity side are via treaties, and as thesetreaties get older, that mortality rates, morbidity rates grow exponentially. So, the riskpremium grows, even if nothing happens, even if no new policies are added, thesetreaties grow for the existing portfolio, because we have risk premiums, which aregrowing.Of course, at some point in time, this goes the other way, because in 50 years all thesetreaties have runoff. But as long as they are still young, 10, 15, sorry -- 10, 15 years old.These treaties are growing. And then, of course, we have treaties, which are open fornew business, and this is another source of growth. So, in general, we expect to reach the5% maybe a little bit more, but this mainly depends on large block transactions, especiallyon one of our focus areas. And that is longevity.Then your question on the retro, yes, it kicks in at 110% population mortality. And that isthe, as mentioned earlier by Clemens, it's a weighted average of the U.S., UK, andAustralian population mortality, weighted with the portfolio of Hannover Re.So, we try to get the correlation between this parametric cover and the results in our ownportfolio as high as possible. So, we tried to optimize that by using our own portfoliostructure to define the parametric cover. And as I said earlier, it's currently stands close to113%, according to our own calculations.And then, the longevity release, yes, we are, when we started 15, 20 years ago, we havelongevity and nobody else was doing that. We embarked on a pretty conservative way ofaccounting for that. So, in the first couple of years and this is still valid today, we only showabout 2% to 3% profit in terms of an EBIT margin. And if the portfolio develops asexpected, we would see and you've seen that now a release of these PADs especiallywhen we do these cleanup of portfolio. With COVID, especially in the U.K., we got the -U.K. is the largest market, we had a lot of claims and most of these claims have not beenaccounted for fully, because the release you have seen probably only includes theupdated portfolio information 12 months ago. So, an awful lot of COVID is still not in there.That is something what we hope to release sometime in the future as soon as we knowthat we have valid data for that from the clients.On P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?Yes. As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for ourexpected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year. From a process pointof view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like weare doing now. So, the EUR1.3 billion is fixed for 2022. Same, of course, goes for the EUR1.1billion we fixed for 2021. And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect apremium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were moreexpecting a growth in the 5% to 7.5% range. So, a good part of the increase in the majorloss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022.As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%on the P&C side. But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average Igave you during the Investors Day, i.e., the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeksago, rather than the 14% after three quarters. By the way, the growth number will comeslightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the fullyear. The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset onour biggest structured contract, we have increased our share. So, there was a significantpremium entry booked in the third quarter. But under that contract, we every year toohave the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there willbe a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on thatparticular contract. And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%rather than staying at the 14.5%, where we are after three quarters.Perfect.

"The next question is from Darius Satkauskas of KBW. Your line is now open. Please goahead.Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, your Solvency II ratio have declined11 percentage points since the end of July. Could you tell us how many Solvency II pointsdid the expected growth account for? And then, is this capturing the next 12 months? So,the 4Q 2022 as well or -- sorry, is it capturing the next 12 months or the entire 2022?And then lastly, do you have a comparable figure for last year, because if I look at theSolvency II decline in 3Q 2020 relative to 1H '20, it's much less pronounced. So, yes, couldyou give us a comparable figure if possible? Thank you.Yes. On Solvency II, it's actually the business growth that we've seen in 2021, that isreflected. So, we've updated our model for the current business growth, which has beensignificant so far and also it includes the full 12 months of 2022. So, that's really the usualplanning cycle that we complete in Q3, and then we include that in our SCR calculation forthe full year 2022, so that's the new business both in P&C and in life and health. So thatincreases -- and then, of course, the higher capacities here and there in P&C and life andhealth. So that's the main driver.I don't have the exact number, but it's going to be a double-digit number, which has beenoffset by some other effects, but I think it's about a double-digit number here. And again,another contributor was, of course, the asset risk due to our slightly changed assetallocation and the increase in alternative investments as mentioned earlier.

"And we have a follow-up question from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now openagain.Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. Sorry to ask again, but on the life side, I mean, I'm justcurious about a few things please.One is that, if I just start with the operated -- the reported EBIT of EUR41 million, and addback COVID mortality data, the longevity is at EUR83 million. And then somewhere fromthe presentation, I picked up that financials -- the deposit accounting was also EUR95million. So, ex deposit accounting, we actually have a loss of about EUR12 million. And I'vebeen made aware that there are some derivatives which went up against in the financial -in the financial statement. I mean, is there anything that you could comment on thissurprisingly negative result on the life side, please? That's really my question.And second question is, on this cover on the pandemic, I think there was a conversationalso in the 2Q results, where it was mentioned that the cover wasn't being activated yet,because of Australian mortality trends, if I recollect. Has that changed? Or is there someupdate on that, that makes you think that next year you could choose this cover?And last follow-up is on getting a question from (inaudible) is there any idea to break outthis burned between (inaudible) and the whole account, please? Thank you.Okay. The first question was the EBIT. I fully understand that you do a little bit of, let's say,recalculation, take a few things out and add others back in, but the COVID reporting ofCOVID claims is, let's say, at least very delayed, if not completely unreliable. So, makingcalculations especially on the quarterly basis, what the usual number would be, it's quitedifficult. We don't get correct information from all our clients, and we definitely don't get itin time. So, adding or subtracting COVID claims from, let's say, audited claims numbers is-- it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I would not necessarily rely on the outcome here.I can't see that we have a negative -- of course, we have a negative results if you look atthe COVID claims on mortality side, it's highly negative, but we have a very stable financialsolutions result. What you have seen in the other result here is the 351, of which 278 isdeposit accounting treaties and they are completely unaffected by COVID. We also havevery positive longevity result, plus even if you ignore the one-off of nearly EUR100 million,which is also only slightly positive impacted by COVID. And the EUR400 million COVIDclaims, of course, drag it down, but the underlying profitability is extremely high andstable. The great unknown for us is how the next COVID variant will develop in '22. Andnobody can tell you anything about that.Vinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which mightexplain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of theunderlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and thesecond quarter and less in the third quarter. But then on top of that, I think the investmentresult on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainlyattributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book.And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C. And then, we have thementioned derivative in the U.K. results and that is -- that was a deviation in the thirdquarter of roughly EUR10 million. So overall, that should round up the picture probably.But definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeksand even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if thathas nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will bereported as a COVID claim in many countries. That doesn't happen. So I don't really relyon this analysis. Definitely not on a quarterly basis. And then, could you just repeat yourquestion on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?As the life pandemic cover was already running at a higher and I think at 2Q, you had saidthat you were not yet counting it in or factoring it because of Australian mortality claims.Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing. But maybe -- yes.The cover is for all three countries in total. So, it's a parametric cover and this stands at100 and close to 113 right now. If nobody dies for the rest of the year, this will fall belowthe 110 and we don't get anything. It's unlikely that we don't even see normal mortality. So,I expect definitely something in -- for this year, but it will only be calculated next year,because the calculation agent relies on official statistics and official statistics, populationstatistics for 2021 will only be available sometime in 2022. And sometimes it's not Januaryor February or anything like that, well the second half of the year. These are civil servantswho produce that.And the calculation agent will only start calculating the final recuperation for us here, assoon as he has all the official statistics from the U.S., from Australia, from the U.K.And the EUR32 million booked in the U.S. COVID 3Q, that looked a bit lower and thatcould be also this late supporting, Klaus, that you

"Sorry --That in the third quarter, the U.S. was rather low mortality in booking of EUR32 millionversus the deaths and the excess straight were nearly EUR100,000.Vinit, sorry, I think -- apologies, Vinit. Go ahead.I think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million toEUR80 million stemming out of South Africa. So that was the bulk. And I think, it's probablya bit higher number than you assume for the U.S. actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,wasn't it in life and health in the U.S.Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.Yes. On burned, Vinit, you know that we have placed a little over EUR300 million of wholeaccounts coverage. So, you should think about burned in the terms of being a substantialpartial loss against our whole account cover. I would not be comfortable to give you theprecise split for the simple reason that the loss happened in the quarter.So therefore, we have not received enough information yet to book each and everyelement of the loss on the bottom-up basis. So, there are still some top-downassumptions included in our gross number for burned. And depending on how that will fallin the end on individual contracts, the split between K and whole account is subject tochange. So, whatever (inaudible) split, I would give you today, would be subject to thatchange. So therefore, I would feel uncomfortable to giving you very precise numbers. Butas I said, you should think about burned as a substantial partial loss against our wholeaccount structure with the remainder going to K.Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

"(Operator Instructions) And we do have a follow-up from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Yourline is now open again.Yes. Two quick questions. The first one would be on the life reside, this longevity PAD. Iguess it was included in your EUR600 million EBIT contribution initially targeted for 2023and that you move to 2024, but just wanted to -- I guess it was included at the time of theInvestor Day. But just wanted to update on that, just to be fully aligned and fully clear. Andthe second question would be on the P&C side or P&C NatCat. What's your overallassessment of the profitability of your book? Maybe you could share with us the year-todate combined ratio or the return on allocated capital you're getting on this book despiterunning ahead of budget? Thank you.Yes. Thomas, this is indeed taking into account the longevity and benefits also that -that's including the EUR600 million.And on the NatCat, so as Jean-Jacques explained in the Q&A, during the Investors Day, ofthe NatCat portfolio is modeling well against our profitability hurdle rate. So, from pricingpoint of view, the last two rounds of rate increases certainly helped to get that portfolio toa better level of profitability. We expect further rate increases on the loss impactedbusiness into 2022. So, from that point of view, we are okay with our profitability on theNatCat side, but at the same time, as we already mentioned on the Investors Day, we willkeep our relative risk appetite for NatCat stable nonetheless. We are not seeing ratesyet, which would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite.On the result point of view, I'm afraid, I don't have those numbers for you. The NatCat isnot a separate segment we are reporting upon, as you know, for few quarters now. So, Iwould not be able to give you those numbers, but Claude can get back to you on those.Thank you.

I think wecovered the ground very well. You've seen a year impacted by large losses on bothbusiness segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, theROE above 10%. And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has beenconfirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022.
