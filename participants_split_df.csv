"['Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call presenting the resultsof Hannover Re for the first nine months of this year', "" As usual, I'll start with an overviewbefore our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the financials in more detail"", ' And then, Iwill comment on the outlook for this year and for 2022', "" For the Q&A, as always, I'madditionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff"", 'In the first nine months of this year, Hannover Re has again proved its resilience in achallenging market environment in life and health reinsurance', ' The results continued to beimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic', ' And in P&C reinsurance, we had to deal with theelevated large losses from natural catastrophes, most prominently the European floodsand Hurricane Ida in the third quarter', 'The fact that we still achieved a double-digit return on equity, year-to-date highlights thestrong underlying profitability of the group and our successful volatility management', 'Additionally, the group net income of EUR856 million is in line with our full year targetrange of EUR1', '15 billion to EUR1', '25 billion, and hence, we have kept our profit guidanceunchanged', 'Gross premium increased by 14', '4% adjusted for currency effects', ' This is mainly driven byour P&C business group, where we recorded continued strong top line growth on theback of improving market conditions and increased demand from our clients, althoughgrowth in life and health reinsurance was also ahead of our expectations', 'In P&C reinsurance, the large loss impact of more than EUR1 billion was clearly above ourbudget for the first nine months', ' Adjusted for this quarterly budget overrun, the technicalprofitability was, however, in line with our expectations', 'Furthermore, this is supported by our unchanged net estimate of COVID-19 relatedlosses, which has now been stable since the end of 2020 at EUR950 million', ' Asmentioned, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a significant impact in life andhealth reinsurance', ' Within our portfolio, the main markets affected by COVID-relatedexcess mortality of the U', 'S', ', but also South Africa, where Hannover Re has a very strongmarket position', 'All-in-all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR404 million and most notablythe third quarter losses of around EUR140 million, came ahead of our initial expectation', 'As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U', 'S', ' mortality portfolio led to apositive one-off effect of EUR129 million', ' Additionally, we recorded a positive effect ofEUR99 million from reserve releases in the longevity in Q3, partly mitigating the COVID-19impact', 'At 2', '9%, the return on investment is significantly ahead of our expectations, mainly drivenby favorable ordinary income', ' Our capitalization according to Solvency II continued to beexcellent confirmed by our strong solvency ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter,well above our 200% threshold', ' The main reason for the decrease in the third quarter isthe increase in required capital due to the attractive business growth, including the growthwe expect to see in 2022', ' This leads to an increase in SCR, whereas the positive impacton own funds is less immediate due to our conservative assumptions for new business', 'Furthermore, large losses in P&C and COVID losses in life and health, had a negativeimpact on the solvency ratio year-to-date', 'The operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2021 reached a record high of EUR4', '2billion, mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results onthe investment side', ' The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from therestructuring within our U', 'S', ' mortality portfolio of EUR640 million', 'Overall, the positive cash flow fueled the strong growth in assets under ownmanagement to an all-time high of about EUR55 billion', ' This growth was additionallysupported by ForEx effects and the issuance of EUR750 million in hybrid capital, alreadyknown in March', ' This bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our totalhybrid capital to EUR3 billion', ' Despite this issuance, we still have material flexibility inregard to our total hybrid capacity', "" On the right-hand side, you can see that our strongprofitability is the main reason for the increase in shareholders' equity"", ' And additionally,the change in OCI was slightly positive, because negative valuation effect were offset bypositive currency translation', ""On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail"", 'Clemens Jungsthof elYes', ' Thank you, Jean-Jacques and good morning, everyone', ' I would dive straight into thereporting for our business groups and start with P&C', ' We now look back at all importantrenewal dates in 2021', ' And you can see gross and net premium in P&C reinsurance grewby a remarkable 18% adjusted for currency effect', 'The growth is highly diversified with particularly strong momentum in North America, inGermany, and in Southeast Asia', ' On top of this, we successfully expanded our structuredreinsurance book, and we also were able to increase the volume of our facultativereinsurance book', ' As in previous years, we would expect the growth in gross premium toslow down somewhat; however, the net premium growth should remain more stable', 'As you all know, the impact from large losses was significant in the third quarter of 2021', 'For Hannover Re, this resulted in net large losses of EUR1', '07 billion for the first ninemonths, clearly above our budget of EUR849 million for the first nine months', ' The net lossestimate for COVID-19 related losses, however, remained unchanged at EUR950 million', 'All together, the combined ratio of 97', '9% for the first nine months is very solid, in light ofthe observed loss activity and the underlying figures are in line with our targets', 'Net investment income in P&C increased based on strong ordinary income, higherrealized gains, and lower impairments', ' Other income and expenses include negativecurrency effects of EUR105 million', ' In the previous year, we had almost the same amountas a positive contribution, and I alluded to that already in the second quarter, that it ismainly an accounting mismatch as we have a similar movement in our equity', ' All together,the EBIT increased strongly to EUR161 million, thanks to the improved investment resultsand the favorable underwriting result, which had been heavily impacted by COVID lossesin the previous year', ' Finally, the tax ratio is at normal level', 'On the next slide, as mentioned, total net large losses accounted for EUR1', ""07 billion,that's EUR221 million above budget"", ' This means that we have already almost reached thelevel of EUR1', '1 billion budgeted for the full year after the first nine months', ' Of course, theyear-to-date budget overall is absorbed in the Q3 result, and hence the EUR251 millionbudgeted for Q3 -- for Q4, are still available', 'On the next slide, looking at our large losses, the two largest events were unsurprisinglythe European floods with a net loss of EUR214 million and Hurricane Ida with EUR306million net for our account', ' On top of this, we have seen further increases in the lossestimates for storm Volker and the Texas freeze on the NatCat side', ' However, man-madelosses also increased by slightly more than EUR100 million in Q3, almost entirely due tothe riots in South Africa, which are included in the property losses with an amount ofEUR94 million', ' Altogether, the impact from both NatCat and man-made losses wassignificant in Q3, pushing the actual loss experience above the budget for the first ninemonths', 'The next slide, as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reportingline', "" The picture I'd say very much reflects the large loss situation"", "" I've just explained,combined ratios for EMEA, affected by the European floods and by the riots in SouthAfrica, while the Americas include significant losses from Hurricane Ida and the Texasfreeze"", 'The worldwide markets show a rather mixed picture', ' Facultative and agricultural businessare mainly impacted by large losses in the technical profitability and credit and surety, aswell as in aviation and marine, is really excellent driven by favorable underlying lossdevelopment and positive reserve runoff', ""Let's move on to life and health, then on the next slide"", ' The pleasing business growth isreflected in both the premium and in value of new business', "" And really, I'd say, comesfrom all our four important categories"", ' Growth is actually quite diversified by region aswell', ' As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the technical result was still affected by losses inconnection with COVID-19', ' Around 85% of the losses stemmed from two markets, EUR197million from the U', 'S', ' and EUR149 million from South Africa', ' The losses in South Africa wereparticularly significant in the third quarter, whereas the losses from the U', 'S', ' were lowerthan in previous quarters', 'On the positive side, we recorded a positive effect of EUR99 million from reservereleases for our longevity portfolio', ' In part to really avoid misunderstandings, I think thisneeds some additional explanation', ' You might be wondering how we can have furtherreserve releases when we have locked in assumptions according to address foraccounting and usually, we do not even have to set up reserves for this kind of treaties', 'The reason is that we have so-called provisions for adverse developments and as Claudealready explained at our Investors Day, not long ago in recent months, we have receivedupdated mortality data from our clients, showing that the mortality within our enforceportfolio has been higher than expected', 'Hence, we could release those provisions for adverse developments those had, becausemore people in our portfolio have actually died than initially assumed, not because weassume any different mortality trends for the future', 'In other words, the impact does not reflect any general change in assumptions for ourlongevity business, which would be uncertain, but only higher mortality in the enforcebook, which of course is completely certain', 'Furthermore, it is also important to note that the updated mortality data is largely for preCOVID period and not affected by the pandemic', 'Finally, as explained in our Q1 conference call, the restructuring of parts of the INGportfolio in U', 'S', ' mortality led to a positive one-off effect affecting various lines items in theP&L', ' In total, the positive impact was EUR129 million', ' The ordinary investment income wasin line with expectations', ' The fair value of financial instruments decreased materially', ' Thenegative impact was driven by the valuation of derivative embedded in a life reinsurancecontract in the UK', ' And additionally, the previous year had benefited from positivevaluation gains from an equity participation', 'Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution fromour Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which is recognized according to thedeposit accounting method', ' Currency effect here in line and has had a rather minorimpact', ' Altogether, the EBIT of EUR220 million is satisfactory, reflecting theaforementioned positive and negative extraordinary effects', 'On the next slide, as usual, a quick look at the non-IFRS metric for business growth in lifeand health, the value of new business according to Solvency II', ' In Q3, we again tookadvantage of the attractive opportunities for financial solutions in the U', 'S', ', but also inChina and we further expanded our longevity book in the UK', ' The total value of newbusiness for the first nine months supports our full year minimum target of EUR250million', ' Furthermore, the pipeline currently looks very promising, and I would say we arewell on track in terms of new business production', 'On the next slide, the development of our investments', "" I think it's fair to say that thedevelopment in the first quarter and in the first nine months of the year was verysatisfactory"", ' The ordinary investment income is particularly strong', ' The main drivers for thisdevelopment are the excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio', ' Then theoverall asset growth fueled by our very positive cash flow as well as the impact fromincreased actual inflation numbers and the associated positive impact on the amortizationof our inflation linked bond', ""Realized gains have also increased compared to last year and are mainly the result ofroutine portfolio management as well as some strategic -- let's say, as we mentioned thesale of listed equities in the first quarter, which have contributed EUR50 million to therealized gains"", ' Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous year,where we had recorded some impairments in the more volatile market environment', "" So,this year's number is more or less at expected low levels to a large extent comprisingregular depreciation on our real estate portfolio"", 'As explained in my comments on life and health, derivative valuation was negative', ' So, theoverall return on investment was 2', '9% and we expect to achieve a higher return than ourinitial full year expectation of roughly 2', '4%', 'Unrealized gains, as you can see here, decreased by around EUR500 million, mainly dueto the increase in interest rates that are compared to year-end 2020', 'On the next slide, well known, I think the asset allocation developed in line with ourstrategy', ' The most notable change is the reallocation from government bonds intocorporate bonds', ' The focus here is on large and small corporates in developed markets', 'The contributions to ordinary investments income is diversified as usual', ' The highlight asmentioned is probably the recovery in the contribution from private equity to the stronglevels we had seen before the market volatility, caused by the pandemic', ""To conclude my remarks, the first nine months and in particularly, the third quarter provedto be a challenging period for the reinsurance industry, and therefore, the overall resultand the fact that we have confirmed our full year profit guidance for 2021 highlightsHannover Re's strong ability to manage and absorb volatility"", ""On that note, I'd hand back to you Jean-Jacques for the comments on the outlook"", 'Thank you very much, Clemens', "" On the next slide, the target metrics confirms Clemens'summary"", ' Most notably, our main profitability target for the group, the return on equity iswell above our minimum target, even though the underwriting results in both P&C and lifeand health are impacted by extraordinary losses', ' This also means that the EBIT growthtargets in P&C and life and health are somewhat distorted by COVID claims', ' Thesetargets being more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the strategiccycle', 'More importantly, growth is significantly ahead of the strategic target, providing a strongbasis for a successful business development in 2022', ""So, before we move on to the outlook for next year, let's have a brief look at ourguidance for the year 2021"", ' As mentioned, the profit guidance remains unchanged', ""Thinking about the individual components contributing to this number, the premiumgrowth is stronger than initially expected, and together with a higher return oninvestment, this should be sufficient to compensate for higher-than-expected large lossesin P&C and higher-than-expected COVID losses in life and health, which were also partlyoffset by positive one-off effect as we've seen"", 'For the fourth quarter, further impacts from COVID claims is likely in life and health', ' Eventhough the development of the pandemic remains uncertain, the accelerating vaccinationprogress in South Africa in particular provides the basis for decreasing excess mortality inthis country', ' The targeted ordinary dividend according to our new definition ascommunicated at our Investors Day is at least the EUR4', '5 paid out this year', ' As before, wewill consider paying a special dividend on top of this if the capitalization exceeds ourcapital requirements for future growth and profit targets are achieved', "" And as of today,I'd say that both sides of trend are being met"", 'As usual, at this time of the year, we publish our guidance for the expectations for nextyear, as mentioned, growth opportunities are attractive, and we therefore, expect grossreturn premium to increase by at least 5%', ' As in previous years, the growth is likely to bemore pronounced in P&C reinsurance', ' The return on investment should be at least 2', '3%,the 10 basis points being -- decrease being -- versus our initial guidance for this year,reflecting the low interest rate environment with reinvestment deals below our portfolioyield', 'The group net income is expected to be within the range of EUR1', '4 billion to EUR1', '5billion, an underlying improvement of around EUR250 million compared to our guidancefor this year', ' The main driver for the improvement is the profitable growth in this andprevious years, in particular in P&C reinsurance', ' And this growth is not only leading to animproved underwriting result, it has additionally led to a very positive cash flow, which inturn forms the basis for the favorable growth in assets under own management', ' And theincreased asset base is expected to more than compensate for the slight reduction inrelative returns', 'In life and health, growth is similarly helpful, but the profitability is also expected toimprove', ' The uncertainty in life and health is somewhat higher due to the futuredevelopment of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' And with this in mind, we have added adisclaimer to the effect that no material COVID lost is -- are included in the guidance', 'In addition, we have not included any potential relief from our mortality rate for cover,which is likely to payout in 2022', ' So, there is some allowance for COVID claims embeddedin our guidance, but no significant numbers', 'Apart from this, the guidance is under the usual provisor the large losses stayed within thebudget in P&C', ' And the budget has increased to EUR1', '3 billion', ' And of course, also thatthere are no major distortions in the capital market', ' The increased large loss budget ismainly a reflection of business growth', ' Last but not least, the dividend policy is the sameas -- for this year', ' The ordinary dividend announced in March 2022 will be our floor for theordinary dividend and we have a potential special dividend on top', "" Altogether, ourguidance reflects the positive development and successful cycle management of thegroup and we're quite positive about the outlook for next year"", 'This concludes my remarks', ' And as always, we would be happy to answer your questions', 'Questions And AnswersThank you', ' So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address thelongevity release', 'Yes', "" Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible)-- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest"", "" So,there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount thatwe've seen this year"", 'Thank you', 'Thank you, Vinit', ' So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status andcredit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this', 'Clemens Jungsthof elYes, Vinit', ' Good morning', "" Let's start with the Solvency I"", "" So, it's really as Jean-Jacquesmentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all"", "" So, if wewould be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on thebasis of Q2 of 250 roughly"", "" So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily"", "" It's the usualexercise that we do in Q3"", ""First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growththat we've seen in this year"", "" But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle forthe next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected newbusiness both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reasonwhy the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio"", "" Again, it's theusual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as wespeak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually"", 'And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, inQ4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4', ' What is probably also worthmentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to abit more alternative investments, et cetera', ' I think that has also contributed to an SCRincrease', ' But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at ournew business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then inthe next quarter', ""Well, it's a question of market share"", ' Given that our subsidiary for the German business,the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business', ' Ourmarket share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but alsothe NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the UnitedStates, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight', 'Yes', ' On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking thosereinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effectinto 2022 from reinstatement premiums', "" I don't have any precise numbers for you on howhigh exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were"", ' So, ratherthan speculating, I guess we will have to come back to you on that', 'Yes', "" That's absolutely correct"", ' Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to ourown calculation', ' From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will dothe calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021', ' Sothat will take some time in 2022 before this information is available', ' But according to ourown calculation, we are getting close to 113% now', 'Sorry, Thomas', 'Thank you', ' So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth inP&C, Sven you can add there again', 'On P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?Vinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which mightexplain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of theunderlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and thesecond quarter and less in the third quarter', "" But then on top of that, I think the investmentresult on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainlyattributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book"", 'And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C', ' And then, we have thementioned derivative in the U', 'K', ' results and that is -- that was a deviation in the thirdquarter of roughly EUR10 million', ' So overall, that should round up the picture probably', ""Clemens Jungsthof elBut definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeksand even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if thathas nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will bereported as a COVID claim in many countries"", "" That doesn't happen"", "" So I don't really relyon this analysis"", ' Definitely not on a quarterly basis', ' And then, could you just repeat yourquestion on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?I think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million toEUR80 million stemming out of South Africa', ' So that was the bulk', "" And I think, it's probablya bit higher number than you assume for the U"", 'S', "" actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,wasn't it in life and health in the U"", 'S', 'Well, thank you very much for joining, and thank you for the great questions', ' I think wecovered the ground very well', "" You've seen a year impacted by large losses on bothbusiness segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, theROE above 10%"", ' And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has beenconfirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022', "" The guidance for '22 shows boththe growth trajectory of the company and the improved quality of the book"", ' So, I think thekey messages were addressed today', ' Thank you very much for all the questions and seeyou next time', '']",Jean-Jacques Henchoz
"['Hi', ' Good morning, everyone', ' Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased catbudget for 2022, the EUR1', '3 billion', "" Because you split that between man-made andNatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21"", "" I guess I'm justcurious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growthor is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talkabout it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volumeversus anything else going on?My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color"", "" I'mjust trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, beforewe'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to updateagain unreleased further PADs"", "" If there's something, it could be that much of a gapbetween when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flowfrom cedents"", ' Thanks', 'Sure', 'Great', ' Thanks very much', ' Thank you', '']",Andrew Ritchie
"['Yes', ' With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versusNatCat', ' So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021', ""So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1"", '3 billion is manmade and EUR1', '050 billion is the natural catastrophe', ' The growth is not a proxy for ourpremium growth ambitions for next year', ' As always, it is the mix between the growth wehave seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our majorloss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipatedgrowth we expect for next year', 'The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related', "" There's only a smallerportion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we arevalidating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three tofour years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of thatis flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022"", 'The credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positiverunoff from old underwriting years', ' We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level ofinsolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runofffor the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that wenow had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus', ' So, the short-termlevel of insolvencies were below our original assumptions', ""And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long"", ' So, three to five years, we couldnow release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years', ""When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and thenet is relatively high"", ' This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both ourtransactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, whichexplains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, thebulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually thedifference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting', ' So, EUR180 million out ofthat gap is coming from our fronting activities', ' So, on Ida, we had -- we have booked Krecoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position', ' And on thewinter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoffin the third quarter, which is due to the very late reporting from ceding companies on thatfreeze loss', ' So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting andcapacity for construction in the U', 'S', ', the reporting is slower compared to the usualreporting periods', ' We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we shouldhave seen the full impact of winter storm Uri with this third quarter figures', 'Yes', ' As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for ourexpected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year', ' From a process pointof view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like weare doing now', ' So, the EUR1', '3 billion is fixed for 2022', ' Same, of course, goes for the EUR1', '1billion we fixed for 2021', ' And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect apremium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were moreexpecting a growth in the 5% to 7', '5% range', ' So, a good part of the increase in the majorloss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022', 'As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%on the P&C side', ' But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average Igave you during the Investors Day, i', 'e', ', the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeksago, rather than the 14% after three quarters', ' By the way, the growth number will comeslightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the fullyear', ' The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset onour biggest structured contract, we have increased our share', ' So, there was a significantpremium entry booked in the third quarter', ' But under that contract, we every year toohave the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there willbe a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on thatparticular contract', "" And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%rather than staying at the 14"", '5%, where we are after three quarters', '']",Sven Althoff
"['Okay', "" Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side"", ' The way how it works aswe -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pensioninsurer', "" And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at theforefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting"", ""So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do thatand they have to change their systems to administer that"", ' And that takes usually at least ayear, sometimes two, sometimes even more', 'We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible)and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we getat least annual update', "" Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes wehave to ask for it"", ' So, a delay of two years is probably the norm', 'And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixedlag, which is fixed from the outset', ' We know exactly these numbers', "" They don't even haveto send it to us"", ' And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have topay', ' And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag', ' We know thatthe treaty is basically going according to plan', ' And then, we just book these numbers', 'What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same assomebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000', "" So, in the monthlyaccounts, you don't see a difference"", ' But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot ofthese claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher thanif somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,much shorter', 'And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especiallywriting new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the(inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start
